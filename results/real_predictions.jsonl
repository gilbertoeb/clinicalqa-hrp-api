There does not appear to be cortical erosion of bone \nor hyperostosis. There is no pronounced perilesional edema. No \nother mass is seen. There is small calcification in the left \ntemporal lobe. There is no shift of normally midline structures. \nMastoid air cells are clear. Visualized paranasal sinuses are \nclear. The orbits appear unremarkable. \nIMPRESSION: Right frontal enhancing mass with necrotic interior \nmost likely a brain neoplasm. Consider MR for further \ncharacterization. \n\nCT Torso ___:\nCT CHEST: The airways are patent up to subsegmental level. There \nare no \nconcerning airspace opacities, or pulmonary nodules. There is no \npleural \neffusion. There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in \nthe mediastinum, hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria. \nThere are subcentimeter lymph nodes in the axilla; however do \nnot meet the CT criteria for pathological enlargement. Calcified \nnodes are also seen in the mediastinum. The heart size is \nnormal. There is no pericardial effusion.   \nCT ABDOMEN: The liver, pancreas, spleen appear normal. The \nadrenal glands \nare normal. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete \ncontrast \nsymmetrically with bilateral hypodensities too small to \ncharacterize, likely small renal cysts. The gallbladder appears \nnormal with gallstones within. There are no pathologically \nenlarged lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum or mesentery. The \nloops of small and large bowel appear normal. The stomach \nappears normal. There is no free fluid. There is no free air.   \nCT PELVIS: The urinary bladder and ureters appear normal. The \nsigmoid and \nloops of small bowel within the pelvis appear normal. There is \nno free fluid in the pelvis. There are no enlarged lymph nodes \nin the pelvic or inguinal area according to CT size criteria. \nOSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are \nseen in the bones. \nIMPRESSION: \n1. No evidence of primary tumor in the CT torso. \n2. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis. \n\nMRI Head ___:\nFINDINGS: There is a 2.7 cm round circumscribed extra-axial mass \nat the right vertex, depressing the paracentral lobule \ninferiorly. There is mild \nassociated vasogenic edema in the adjacent frontal and parietal \nlobes. The \nmass demonstrates isointensity on the pre-contrast T1-weighted \nimages, mild hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, neither fast \nnor slow diffusion, and predominantly solid enhancement with a \nsmall non-enhancing center on the postcontrast T1-weighted \nimages. A small portion of the non-enhancing center demonstrates \nlow signal on the gradient-echo images without evidence of \nblooming, which is somewhat more likely to represent \ncalcification rather than blood products. Faint hyperdensity \nwithin the mass on the preceding CT scan is compatible with \neither calcification or blood products. Overall, the mass is \nmost consistent with a meningioma.  \nNo other intra-axial or extra-axial masses are seen. The \nventricles are \nnormal in size and configuration. There is no acute infarction. \nThe major \narterial flow voids are unremarkable. \nIMPRESSION: 2.7 cm extra-axial mass at the right vertex, most \nlikely a \nmeningioma, with mild vasogenic edema in the paracentral lobule. \n\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nPatient is a ___ who is transferred from OSH after \nidentification of new right parietal mass in the setting of \nseizure.

His \nPCP was contacted and noted patient did not have any history of \nVTE or PE in the time that he has known him ___ years). He had \nhypercoagulability workup at OSH with negative ___, at-3, \nprotein c,s, d-dimer, pt/ptt all of which were WNL. His PCP also \nnoted that he does not prescribe the patient narcotics, and the \npatient himself notes that he doesn't see PCPs. He underwent \nbronchoscopy done in OR ___ without any lesions or signs of \nbleeding, EGD which showed hematin in the stomach without any \nsigns of bleeding, ENT exam ___ which showed no evidence of \nbleeding. H/H were monitored throughout that admission and were \nstable, and per the discharge summary, though he produced blood \nin specimen cups, no healthcare providers were ever able to \nwitness true hemoptysis or hematemesis.\n\nFor full ___ records, please see scanned records.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nBRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE\n================\nMr. ___ is a ___ year old gentleman with reported history of \nVTE/PEs without confirmatory imaging not on warfarin, recently \nadmitted to ___ with hemoptysis but extensive workup was \nnegative, re-presenting with unwitnessed hematemesis. \nHemodynamically stable, stable hematocrit, no emesis during \nadmission. Coorborated negative history of DVT/ PE from outside \nrecords. Patient has been to numerous hospitals over past few \nyears without clear precipitants. He was discharged to follow up \nwith a new PCP.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES\n==========\n# Hematemesis - During this admission the patient did not have \nany episodes of emesis in the ED or while on the floor. In \nhouse, his hematocrit was stable. Work-up of hematemesis at \n___ within the last week has included (1) EGD \n(2) ENT exam (3) bronchoscopy, all of which were unrevealing. \nHis EGD was noted to have hematin in the stomach, but the \nunderlying mucosa was normal and without any source of bleeding. \nIn the ED, NG lavage was negative, he had guaiac positive stool, \nwhich in the setting of recent NG tube placement, multiple \nrecent hospitalizations (most recently that we know of was one \nweek ago) with multiple instances of GI instrumentation - guaiac \npositive stool is expected. Throughout this admission, he was \nhemodynamically stable and with stable HCT, as such, we treated \nconservatively and decreased his PO pantoprazole because of low \nsuspicion of peptic ulcer disease. Per nursing, he may have \nhistory of sucking blood from ___ and ingesting it or vomiting \nit up, though this is unconfirmed (though at ___, he did have \nold blood in his stomach without evidence of ulcer disease).\n*** Please see \"Results\" section for brief synopsis of ___ \nrecords. ***\n\n# Chest pain: He reported chest pain that was stable and \nconstant. He had an EKG on admission without evidence of R heart \nstrain and no evidence of ischemia. He is low risk for ACS and \ndoes not report a history of CAD, and as his pain is stable and \nongoing in the setting of non-ischemic EKG, as such we deferred \nformal ischemia work-up and monitored on telemetry without any \nconcerning changes. In addition, per OSH records does not have \nany documented pulmonary emboli; he reports 5 PEs in the past \nbut has not been on anticoagulation. He was hemodynamically \nstable, without hypoxia, tachycardia, or concerning EKG signs, \nas such there was minimal indication for CT-A.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n===========\n# Reported history of DVT, PE, hypercoagulability: As above, his \nwork-up was negative. Per OSH records he does not have any \ndocumented history of VTEs. He reported he has no-showed \"about \nfive\" appointments for ___ placement. He does not \nhave any H&P findings concerning for DVT, and we held off on \ntreatment.\n\n# Chronic back pain: We continued his home medications in house, \nwhich he reports were prescribed by a doctor in ___. He \nreports he hasn't seen a primary care provider in years, and \ndoes not go to primary care providers, only hospital. We \ndischarged with 2 days of pain medications and referred him to a \nnew PCP in the ___.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n==============\n- Code status: Full code, confirmed.\n- Emergency contact: Mother, ___ ___\n- Studies pending at discharge: None.\n- Low suspicion for GI bleed and hypercoagulability, but \nconsider GI referral as outpatient. Please also consider \npsychiatry evaluation as there is some element of \nprimary/secondary gain in his frequent presentations.\n*** Please see \"Results\" section for brief synopsis of ___ \nrecords. ***\n- Would benefit from close follow-up to avoid multiple \nre-admissions.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

However the rest of the ___ \nimage major branches demonstrate no high-grade stenosis, \nocclusion or aneurysm greater than 3 mm. The dural venous \nsinuses are patent.\n \nCT neck\nThere is mild-to-moderate calcified atherosclerosis of the \ncommon carotid\nwithout mild stenosis without occlusion or dissection. The left \ninternal\ncarotid artery demonstrates mild to moderate narrowing by NASCET \ncriteria\nsecondary to calcified atherosclerosis. The right internal \ncarotid artery\ndemonstrates no stenosis by NASCET criteria. The vertebral \narteries\ndemonstrate minimal atherosclerosis without high-grade stenosis, \nocclusion or dissection.\n \nOther\nMultiple borderline mediastinal lymph nodes do not meet CT \ncriteria for\nlymphadenopathy. The ascending aorta is aneurysmal and measures \nup to 4.2 cm. The main pulmonary artery measures up to 3.0 cm \nand is borderline enlarged which may suggest some component of \npulmonary artery hypertension.\n \nMild biapical pleuroparenchymal scarring. The visualized lungs \ndemonstrate no nodularity or consolidation. The visualized \nthyroid is unremarkable.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ right-handed man with history \nnotable for atrial fibrillation (on apixaban), HTN, HLD, CAD, \nOSA (on CPAP), C7-T1 radiculopathy s/p ESI, bipolar II disorder, \nand subclinical hypothyroidism who presented to the ___ \nemergency department after an episode of dizziness, syncope, and \nsubsequent left-sided weakness. Due to the left-sided weakness, \nneurology was consulted with concern for stroke. He was admitted \nto the neurology service. Notably, he has had several prior \nepisodes of presyncope and vertigo provoked by climbing stairs \nat his work, but not in other settings and not. Without \nprovocation\n\nNeurologic exam was generally unremarkable, with full strength \nthroughout. There was some give way on the left side. \n___ maneuver was negative. CT scan of the head, and CTA \nof the head neck were unrevealing for any acute pathology. Lab \nwork did not suggest any evidence of hypovolemia or other \nsignificant derangement. Orthostatic vital signs were negative. \nTelemetry monitoring did not capture any arrhythmia. He was able \nto ambulate around the floor, as well as up and down stairs, \nwithout any reproduction of his symptoms.\n\nOverall, his symptoms of presyncope and vertigo were not \nsuggestive of stroke. MRI brain was therefore not obtained. \nBased on his reassuring exam, there is no immediately apparent \nneurologic diagnosis to explain his symptoms. As he has had \nextensive cardiac evaluation in the past, this was not repeated \nhere. We recommend he continue to follow with his primary care \ndoctor as well as cardiologist given the exertional nature of \nhis symptoms. Referral to ENT could also be considered.\n\nThis patient was prescribed, or continued on, an opioid pain \nmedication at the time of discharge (please see the attached \nmedication list for details).

However, mild pulmonary edema is still present. The \nheart is \nenlarged in unchanged manner and a right pleural effusion with \nsubsequent \natelectasis is still present.  Unchanged position of the \npacemaker leads. \n\nTEE ___:\nNo spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of \nthe left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right \natrium/right atrial appendage. A patch is visualized at inferior \nportion of the interatrial septum and extending below the level \nof the tricuspid valve, consistent with known previous \nendocardial cushion defect repair. Flow is seen by color Doppler \nacross the atrial portion of the patch c/w with a small residual \nshunt. The superior portion of the interatrial septum is not \nwell visualized. Overall left ventricular systolic function is \nlow normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size is \nnormal. with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve \nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \nexcursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve \nleaflets are mildly/moderately thickened. There is no mitral \nvalve prolapse. The posterior mitral leaflet appears short and \nrestricted with lack of coaptation with the anterior leaflet. An \neccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate to severe (3+) \nmitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic \npressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial \neffusion. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe degree of mitral regurgitation is probably similar (likely \nunderestimated due to the very eccentric jet previously). A \nsmall residual shunt across the interatrial patch is better seen \non the current study. Other findings are similar.  \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ w/ h/o endocardial cushion and ASD defect s/p repair as \nchild, CHF (LVEF ___ =60%), moderate-severe MR, afib s/p PPM \np/w acute dyspnea in context of missing lasix dose and with \nrecurrent R pleural effusion.  \n\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n\n#dCHF: pt presented with symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea, and PND \nand on exam was mildly volume overloaded. pro-BNP was elevated \nto >1700. An echo 3 weeks prior to admission revealed no \ninterval changes but moderate-severe mitral regurgitation. The \npt was diuresed with lasix 20 mg IV x2 with symptomatic \nimprovement. Her oxygen requirement of 2L NC was gradually \nweaned off. A TEE to further evaluate her mitral regurgitation \ndid not reveal a worsening MR or systolic/diastolic function. \nShe was deemed to not be a surgical candidate at this time. She \nwas discharged on lasix 20mg PO qday.\n\n#Pleural Effusion: pt presented with acute dyspnea and a CXR \nrevealed a large pleural effusion on the right side. The left \nside was normal. This is a recurrent effusion and previous \nthoracenteses have revealed that it is transudative in nature. \nIt is thought to be related to heart failure. Given the ___ \nprevious instances of this effusion, it was decided that instead \nof attempting another thoracentesis, the pt would be diuresed. \nShe was given lasix 20mg IV x2 with negative output of -1.6L x2 \ndays. This resulted in signifcant improvement of her dyspnea and \nher pleural effusion. Her lasix was increased from her home dose \nof 20mg PO QOD to 20mg PO qday. \n\n#AFIB s/p PPM: pt had her pacemaker interrogated to assess if it \nwere malfunctioning and if this could have contributed to her \nrecurrent effusions and dCHF exacerbation. It was found to be \nworking appropriately after interrogation. She was continued on \nher home metoprolol but her rivaroxaban was held for a TEE and \nrestarted on discharge.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n\n#DMII: her home anti-glycemics were held and she was placed on \nan insulin sliding scale\n\n#HLD: she was continued on her home statin\n\n#seizure: she was continued on her home phenobarbital \n\n#thombocytopenia: likely related to phenobarbital. she was \nrunning at her baseline. \n\nTransitional issues:\n- monitor response to increased dose of furosemide (20mg daily)\n- repeat CXR to confirm resolution of effusion\n- Lung nodule seen anterior to the spine on the lateral view of \ninitial chest X-ray. consider CT to further evaluate when \neffusion and pulmonary edema resolve\n- medication reconciliation and teaching\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Most likely source of infection was skin/soft tissue \nsince this was his predominant complaint. CT and MRI of the \nlower extremities were not consistent with necrotizing fascitis. \nSkin continued to worsen over the first 3 days of hospital \ncourse, and developed dramatic bullae in dependent regions of \nthe LEs. Paracentesis with 250 polys implied either a primary or \nsecondary intra-abdominal process. Patient received albumin on \ndiagnosis and 2 days later for renal prophylaxis in the setting \nof SBP. Blood cultures from admission eventually grew \npansensitive Strep penumonia and he was initially managed on \nvancomycin, ceftriaxone and clindamycin, which was changed to \nvanco/cefepime/clindamycin with ID input. TTE and TEE were \nnegative for endocarditis. No evidence of embolic phenomenon \nwere noted. Final etiology was not clear at the time of transfer \nfrom the ICU, but ID felt patient likely had SBP which seeded \npatient hematogenously, which led to embolic phenomenon to the \nlower extremities. The ICU team felt that patient may have \nstarted with a soft tissue infection, which led to hemeatogenous \nspread, which may have then led to seeding of the peritoneal \nfluid. Strep pneumo has been described as a rare cause of \ncellulitis in case reports. Workup also included negative ANCA, \nrelatively normal complement, and negative CMV. When final \nspeciation from blood culture returned patient was transitioned \nto Ceftriaxone alone prior to transfer to the floor. Pt was \nafebrile while on ___ 10 with stable vital signs. Wound care \ncontinued to follow patient and daily dressing changes were \ninitated. While on ___ 10 patient complained of right lower \nback/upper buttock pain. Dermatology evaluated patient and felt \nthat the dermatomal distribution of the pain warranted VZV \nprohylaxis. Patient was swiftly transferred to ___ 5 to protect \ntransplant patients from VZV exposure. He was eventually found \nnot to have VZV and antivirals were stopped.  The patient's \ndistal lower extremity wounds were managed with antibiotics \nincluding the above Ceftriaxone and vancomycin which were \neventually discontinued and Daptomycin was started and stopped \nat time of discharge.\n.  \n#. Altered mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to \ninfection +/- hepatic encephalopathy and narcotics received in \nED with decreased ability to metabolize narcotics in setting of \nliver disease. Improved after extubation with lactulose and \nrifaximin.\n.  \n#. Hyponatremia: Concerning for hepatorenal vs hypovolemic \nhyponatremia. Diff also includes SIADH from pain. Improved with \nfluids while in the ICU. Because of his hypersosmolar urine on \nthe floor, he was presumed to have SIADH and he eventually was \nrestricted to 1500ml fluids per day on the floor and his \nhyponatremia reversed. He developed hyponatremia later in his \nhospital course which was again concerning for hepatorenal \nsyndrome. He was given IV concentrated albumin and his sodium \nremained stable and borderline low at time of discharge.\n.  \n# CKD: Cr 1.7 near baseline 1.6 on ___. Improved to baseline \nprior to transfer out of out the ICU and stabilized on the \nfloor.  \n.\n# Pancytopenia, coagulopathy: Platelets mildly below baseline, \nhct mildly below baseline, but WBC remained stable. Given \nelevated INR, there was some concern for DIC in the setting of \ninfection. CBC stabilized and INR improved with holding of \ncoumadin and treatment of infectious process. He developed \nneutropenia again later in his hospital course. Ceftriaxone and \nvancomycin were discontinued and his WBC count returned to a \nnormal range. \n.  \n#. Anemia/Bleeding from OGT: Hct 26 at most recent baseline 27 \nand stable. Had some blood mixed with bile from OGT and has \nknown varices but no further output. Received 2 U PRBC while in \nthe unit with stable Hct. Hct was stable on the floor. \n.  \n#. Cirrhosis ___ HCV c/b varices, ascites, h/o encephalopathy on \ntransplant list: Elevated INR and low albumin consistent with \ndecompensated cirrhosis. MELD 27 on admission but improved to 18 \nthereafter. Propanolol was held secondary to bradycardia in the \nICU. Continue on rifaximin, and lactulose was started for \naltered mental status that improved after extubation, now \nstopped. \n.\n# Volume status: Once he reached the floor, he had significant \nascites and ___ edema, diuresis was initiated first with lasix \nand eventually with both lasix and aldactone while monitoring \nhis electrolytes. He underwent a 3L paracentesis and was placed \non a 1500ml fluid restriction. His edema stabilized as did his \nserum sodium while on this regimen.    \n.  \n# Asthma: Currently without wheezing or resp symptoms.  \n.  \n#. Atrial fibrillation: Remained rate controlled. Coumadin \ninitially held for suprathereapeutic INR. Propanolol was held \nfor bradycardia and prolonged pr interval. While on ___ 10 \npatient was noted to be in sustained atrial flutter. Propranolol \nwas restarted at 5mg tid. Shortly after first dose patient was \nbradycardic to the high 40's. He appeared confused and \ncomplained of weakness. The decision was made to DC his \npropranolol again. His symptoms resolved shortly after that.  \nHis propanolol was not restarted on the floor. He also \nexperienced multiple 2 second pauses on telemtry during his time \non the floor. He was restarted on coumadin and discharged on a \ndose of 4mg with plans to follow his INR with Dr. ___ \nPCP.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nErgocalciferol ___ units daily  \nAlbuterol 2 puffs TID  \nSymbicort 160-4.5 2 puffs BID  \nClotrimazoel troche 10mg PO dissolved in mouth 5 times er day  \nFlutes 50meg spray suspension 2 spraysto each nostril daily  \nLasix 40mg 2 tabs PO daily  \nMethylphenidate 5mg PO TID  \nPantoprazole 40mg PO BID  \nProporanolol 10mg PO BID  \nRifaximin 400mg PO TID  \nSpironolactone 50mg PO daiky  \nCoumadin 5mg PO qhs  \ncalcium carbonate 600mg PO BID  \nDiphenydramine-Tylneol PO BID  \nFerrous sulfate 325mg PO TID  \nFolic acid ___ PO qam  \nGlucosamine Chondroitin Complex 1 tab PO BID  \nLoperamide 2mg PO BID  \nMagnesium oxide 1 tablet po qam  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

The patient was medically \nmanaged with intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest and \nsubsequently improved. Diet was slowly advanced without issues. \nThe patient remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable. \n\n# Perforated Acute Diverticulitis\n# Neutropenia\nPresented with worsening acute abdominal pain since being \ndischarged following the second cycle of MiDAC. CT abd/pelvis \nshowed a perforated acute diverticulitis. Evaluated by surgery \nand BMT in ED, and the decision was made to pursue conservative \nmanagement with IV antibiotics. She was initially started on \nvancomycin/zosyn overnight, switched to meropenem due to a \ncefepime allergy. Patient initially placed on bowel rest and \nthen advanced to regular diet without issues. Her pain resolved \nwith time, though 1 week later, while neutropenic, she developed \nan isolated temperature of 100.5 in the setting of 48 hours of \ncrampy \"gas like\" LLQ abdominal pain. Other vitals were stable. \nRepeat CT A/P with PO contrast demonstrated worsening of the \ndiverticulitis and perforation. Surgery consulted, recommended \nsurgery on this admission. However, given patient preference and \nhigh risk of surgery with neutropenia, we continued a \nconservative course, re-added vancomycin to her regimen for \nfebrile neutropenia and made her NPO; remained HD stable and \npain free. Decided not to use neupogen given again patient \npreference but also risk of bowel perf with neupogen. 7 days \nlater, once her neutrophils recovered and reached > 3000, repeat \nCT A/P with oral contrast showed improvement in bowel edema and \nperforation.
