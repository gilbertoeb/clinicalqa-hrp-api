{"subject_id": 15320468, "hadm_id": 51902752, "context": "WET READ: ___ ___ ___ 8:27 PM\n  Esophageal catheter courses below the diaphragm and curves superiorly\n  projecting over the left upper quadrant, likely within the stomach. Persistent\n  abnormal appearance to the left lower hemithorax with slight improved\n  aeration. Given the course of the esophageal catheter, diaphragmatic hernia is\n  a possibility, chronicity indeterminate. Left pleural effusion is also a\n  possibility. This could be further evaluated with CT, as recommended\n  previously.\n ______________________________________________________________________________\n                                 FINAL REPORT\n HISTORY:  ___ placement.\n \n CHEST, SINGLE AP PORTABLE VIEW.\n \n An ET tube is present, the tip lies approximately 3.6 cm above the carina.  \n \n The heart is not enlarged.  The aorta is calcified.  There is upper zone\n redistribution and mild diffuse vascular blurring, consistent with\n interstitial edema.  There is opacification at the left base, with obscuration\n of the left hemidiaphragm, in an unusual configuration.  The appearance raises\n question of a large gastric and/or diaphragmatic hernia.  \n \n An NG tube is present, the tip extends to the level of the lower mediastinum\n and overlies the left upper quadrant near the expected site of the physiologic\n diaphragm.  A left effusion cannot be excluded.  There is minimal atelectasis\n at the right base and minimal blunting of the right costophrenic angle.\n \n IMPRESSION:\n \n 1.  ET tube in satisfactory position.\n 2.  Interstitial edema.\n 3.  Atypical opacity in the left mid and lower zones raising the question of\n gastric and/or diaphragmatic hernia.
