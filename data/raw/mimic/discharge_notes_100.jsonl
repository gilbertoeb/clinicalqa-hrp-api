There is near complete opacification of the \nleft hemithorax with only a small residual aerated lung noted \nlaterally in the lower aspects of the hemithorax in the region \nof the indwelling pleural drain. The right lung is largely \nclear. The mediastinum cannot be adequately assessed.

It now occupies most of the volume of the left \nhemithorax. In the \nbasal dorsal regions of the fluid collection, a single septation \nis seen. \nOtherwise, no septations or loculations can be visualized. The \nfluid is \ncontained in a sac of thickened and hypodense pleura. At the \nbasolateral \nparts of this pleural site, a laterally positioned drain is \nvisualized. The pleural sac displaces the mediastinum to the \nright. Several high density and enlarged lymph nodes are seen, \nnotably at the ventral circumference of the pleural sac, at the \nlevel of the aortic arch and in the aortopulmonary window. \nSimilar structures are also seen in the subcarinal region. Mild \npericardial effusion, small hiatal hernia. In the right lung, a \nsmall subpleural nodules has newly occurred (3,17).

CT chest with \nnew anterior effusion. Patient was discussed with IP who said \nthey would see the patient on the floor. Patient remained stable \non room air.  \n.  \n \n.\n# Dyspnea: Given imaging, likely ___ lung collapse from \nworsening malignant pleural effusion. The effusion appears to \nhave an anterior and posterior compartment. The posterior \ncompartment is being drained by her pleurex which is working \nappropriately. On arrival the the floor the patient was seen by \n___. They noted that her posterior pigtail was draining well. \nThey did an anterior thoracentesis and drained 1.1L of \nserosanguinous fluid.  IP was concerned for bleeding into her \npleural cavity, but thoracentesis is serosangionous so more \nlikely malignant effusion. No fever, chills or leukocytosis \nconcerning for infection.  The patient's repeat CXR \npost-thoracentesis showed mild improvement in aeration and \nmediastinal shift.  The follow up CXR from day after \nthoracentesis showed reaccumulation of the fluid.  The patient \nhad no 02 requirement and 02 sat ranged 93-100%.  \n-will f/u with IP the week of discharge for likely drain \nplacement. \n.  \n# Thyroid Cancer: Spoke to patient's outpatient oncologist and \nthe patient has failed sorafenib, her only future option would \nbe chemo. However, per her outpatient PCP notes, the patient is \nnot interested in future chemo.  \n-outpatient ONC follow up.  \n.  \n# Hypoparathyroidism with hypocalcemia:  Patient continued on \nhome calcitriol and calcium.  Calcium 7.7 on DOA.\n.\n#Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: Patient not anticoagulated as \noutpatient.  She was continued on 200 amiodarone daily and \nmetoprolol.  \n.  \n# Hypothyroidism:  Patient continued on levothyroxine. \n.  \n# Anemia: Patient's HCT decreased by 6 overnight.  CXR was \nrepeated and did not show evidence of hemothrorax.  Repeat HCT \nincreased so likely lab error and dilutional effect of IVF.  \nAlso, patient had some mild bleeding with thoracentesis.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nAmiodarone 200 mg alternating with 100 mg daily,  \nCalcitriol 0.25 mcg daily,  \nLevothyroxine 0.125 mg tablets  \nMetoprolol 25 mg b.i.d.  \nProchlorperazine 10 mg every four hours as needed for nausea,  \nCalcium 3 g daily,  \nLoperamide as needed  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Back pain - without red flags such as bowel \nincontinence/saddle anesthesia and with normal rectal tone. DDX \nincluded infection such as abscess, diskitis or osteomyelitis \nfrom potential seeding after his epidural injection (though less \nlikely with unchanged MRI and physical exam). Less likely items \non the differential included cauda equina (unlikely in this pt \nwithout saddle anesthesia, bilateral sciatica, leg weakness, \nnegative MRI, normal rectal tone).  Of note, we considered \nrecurrent prostate cancer on the DDX; however, patient has been \nbiochemically disease free following his hormonal therapy, as \nper heme/onc notes in ___. Most likely etiology was felt \nto be progression of patient's spinal stenosis, despite \nunchanged MRI findings.  Initially attempted pain control with \ntylenol, but patient's pain adequately controlled on ultram 50 \nmg q4 hours and ibuprofen 600 mg q6 hours prn with lidocaine \npatch.

Hyponatremia may have been \npossible contributor, as his mental status improved throughout \nhospitalization.  After initial exam, patient did not exhibit \nany disorientation for the remainder of his hospitalization.  We \nalso avoided narcotics in this patient who has had prior AMS \nwith narcotics.\n.\n3. Hyponatremia - Na 129 on admission.  Pt initially fluid \nchallenged for suspected dehydration, without Na correction and \ndownward trend.  Urine lytes were much more consistent with a \nSIADH picture (high Uosm, high UNa).  With salt tablets and free \nwater restriction to 1500 mL/day, pt's sodium corrected.  \nDischarge Na 130.  Pain may have contributed to part of the \nSIADH picture, although pain was adequately controlled for past \nseveral days prior to d/c.  Hypervolemic conditions (including \ncirrhosis, nephrotic dz, cardiac dz) leading to low Na much less \nlikely given physical exam and laboratory values.\n.\n4.

There are surgical clips \nin the right upper \nquadrant. There is a nonobstructive gas pattern. There are \nvascular \ncalcifications. \n  \nIMPRESSION: Capsule present around the rectosigmoid junction. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nPrimary Reason for Admission: ___ y/o woman with PMHx significant \nfor CAD s/p CABG ___ (occluded SVG to OM and SVG to PDA grafts, \noccluded LIMA to LAD, occluded RCA and occluded LCx stent), PCI \n___, ___ (EF 35-40%), NSTEMI ___ and multiple GIBs requiring \ntransfusions who was admitted to ___ ___ for scheduled CABG \nand MVR who was found to have an LV aneurysm and HCT 16 now \nadmitted to ___ for workup of anemia and further eval of LV \naneurysm.\n.\nActive Problems:\n.\n# Anemia: Pt was found to have HCT of 16 on pre-op ABG. Given \nextensive h/o GIBs requiring transfusion and the acuity of her \nHCT drop, GIB is the most likely cause of her anemia. She was \ntransfused 4U pRBCs with appropriate repsonse and admitted to \n___. The pt was guiac negative and denied BRBPR, hematemesis or \nhemoptysis. She did endorse melana, though she takes oral FeSO4 \nsupplementation. On ___ pt had a melanotic BM that was \nguiac positive. GI was consulted and recommended capsule \nendoscopy to r/o small bowel source. Capsule study was \nunremarkable, but of poor quality. Push enteroscopy was then \nperformed and showed angioectasias in the proximal jejunum and \nmid jejunum (thermal therapy), as well as esophageal/gastric \nvaricies and gastritis (no active bleeding). Fe, folate, B12, \nhaptoglobin and reticulocyte count were all appropriate and the \npt's HCT remained stable throughout the remainder of her course. \nUltimately, her anemia was felt to be ___ GIB, though we were \nunable to find an actively bleeding source. Given her HCT \nremained stable after her initial presentation, this is \ncompatible with a self-limited GIB. She was discharged home. \n.\n# CAD: Pt remained CP free througout her course and her \nmedications were continued. She was discharged home with \ninstructions to return to the hosptial next week for elective \nCABG. \n.\n# LV Aneurysm: Pt was noted to have an LV aneurysm on pre-op \nTEE. TTE was performed on ___ that conformed presence of \naneurysm and was negative for mural thrombus. On ___, \nCardiac MRI was preformed; final read was pending at the time of \ndischarge. \n.\n# CHF: Pt with EF 25%. She received a large osmotic load with 4U \npRBCs and was diuresed with Lasix 20mg IV x2 upon arrival to the \nfloor. She responded well to the lasix and was euvolemic s/p \ndiuresis. She remained comfortable on RA throughout her course, \nand there was no clinical evidence of CHF exacerbation during \nher stay. \n.\nChronic Problems:\n.\n# MR: Pt with known, severe MR. ___ the setting of EF 25%, she \nwould benefit from MVR to improve forward flow and quality of \nlife. This is planned to coincide with CABG. \n.\n# Cirrhosis: Pt with known Primary Biliary Cirrhosis; her \nursodiol 500mg po bid \nwas continued throughout her course. \n.\n# Hypothyroidism: Her levothyroxine was continued throughout her \ncourse. \n.\nTransitional Issues: Pt remained stable througout her course. \nShe was d/c'ed home with plan for elective CABG next week.

There is \nno pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Interval removal of right \nsided PICC. Known esophageal stent barely seen. \n  \nIMPRESSION: No evidence of pneumonia. \n\nCTA CHEST:\n1. Complete occlusion of the left subclavian artery by a large \ncalcified \natherosclerotic plaque at its origin is incompletely evaluated \nin this exam but raises concern for subclavian steal syndrome. \nEvaluation of differential upper extremity blood pressure should \nbe performed. Dense calcification was also seen at the level of \nocclusion in the non enhanced chest CT from ___, \nsuggesting chronicity. \n2. No evidence of pulmonary embolism or acute aortic syndrome. \n3. No esophageal extravasation of contrast or penumomediastinum \nidentified.  However, this supine study is limited for \nassessment of esophageal perforation and an upper GI study \nshould be performed if there is further clinical concern. \n4. Bibasilar ground-glass opacities with nodular components, \nmore prominent in the right base, are slightly worsened than in \nthe previous exam. Given short term progression this likely \nrepresents infection versus aspiration.  However, continued \nfollow up after treatment is recommended to assess for \nresolution of nodular component in this patient with history of \nesophageal cancer. \n\nCarotid US:\nIMPRESSION:  Diffuse distal common carotid and carotid \nbifurcation plaque with no significant stenosis.  Reversal of \nflow is seen in the left vertebral artery consistent with a \nknown subclavian occlusion. \n\nFOOT X RAY:\nTHREE VIEWS, LEFT FOOT: \nThere is an ulceration measuring approximately 2.2 cm on the \nplantar aspect of the left foot at the level of the \ntarsometatarsal joints.  There is a somewhat chronic-appearing \nerosion at the base of the first metatarsal medially.  If this \ncorresponds to the site of the ulcer, this could reflect \nosteomyelitis.  Otherwise, this represents a nonspecific erosion \nwhich could be seen in the setting of an inflammatory \narthropathy or gout.  There are mild degenerative changes of the \nleft foot.  A moderate-sized plantar calcaneal spur is noted. \n\nBlood, Urine cx, Legionella: Negative\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with esophageal carcinoma recently hospitalized and started \non chemo/XRT, now neutropenic, presents with fever, cough, \ndyspnea, and chest pain, CT findings suggestive of PNA as well \nas incidental left subclavian artery occlusion/stenosis, new \natrial fibrillation, and chronic foot ulcer.\n\nPresumed infectious/bacterial PNA: Based on new symptoms of \ncough, fever, dyspnea, and chest pain.  Neutropenic so high risk \nfor bacterial infection, and also high risk for resistance given \nrecent prolonged hospitalization.  Was initially given \nVanco/Cefepime/Levofloxacin with rapid improvement.  He was then \nweaned to Levofloxacin alone with continued benefit.  Cultures \nwere negative.  He was discharged to complete a full course with \nLevofloxacin.\n\nSubclavian artery stenosis/occlusion: Asymptomatic but clear BP \ndifference on exam.  Findings suggest chronicity.  Diminished \nradial pulse.  Carotid/Vertebral ultrasound demonstrated \nexpected reversal of flow.  Vascular surgery was consulted and \nfelt he had subclavian steal, but no syndrome given he was \nasymptomatic.  They recommended 3 month follow up.\n\nNeutropenia: Likely chemo induced.  Counts improved prior to \ndischarge\n\nEsophageal carcinoma: Poorly differentiated.  s/p stenting, \nchemo, xrt.  XRT was continued in house and will continue as \noutpatient.  Appointment with Dr. ___ was to be rescheduled.\n\nNew Atrial Fibrillation: Noted on admission EKG.  Asymptomatic \nand controlled.  CHADS2 = 0.  This was discussed with patient.  \nAspirin 81mg daily was initiated on discharge.\n\nChronic foot ulcer: Wound care and podiatry were consulted.  \nXray was performed showing erosion but no clear osteomyelitis.  \nPodiatry recommended WTD dressings daily, CAM boot, and close \nfollow up\n\nPUD: PPI continued\n\nCode: FULL, confirmed\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nOmeprazole 20 mg PO BID \nSucralfate 2 gm PO BID \nOndansetron 8 mg PO Q8H:PRN nausea \nProchlorperazine 10 mg PO Q6H:PRN nausea \nAlleve prn, last dose yesterday\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Unlikely ischemia as had no EKG changes, no arrythmias \non telemetry, and no evidence of infection such as UTI or PNA. \nHypervolemic on exam. Patient was diuresed with a lasix gtt drip \nand was negative ___ L and down ___ kg in weight prior to \ndisscharge. Her beta blocker was continued and imdur was added.\nHer digoxin was discontinued after supratherapeutic digoxin \nlevel was discovered, and was restarted on discharge on a \n___ schedule. Nutriton consult was obtained \nand patient was given information on sodium and fluid restricted \ndiets. Kept daily weights, kept on sodium and fluid restricted \ndiet and strict Is and Os.

Patient has had similar tropnin \nelevation on previous admissions for CHF exacerbations. She was \ncontinued on ASA, beta blocker, imdur, and plavix. She has an \nallergy to lipitor, but her lipid panel showed \nhypertriglyceridemia and LDL not at goal and so she was started \non pravastatin, which she tolerated well.   \n\n#.

Patient also \nhad some issues with bleeding from heparin SQ and some \nassociated mild thrombocytopenia (platelets 120s =\u003e 100s), so it \nwas discontinued and she was switched to pneumoboots. Receives \nAranesp 25 mcg qweekly, last dose ___. She will follow in \noutpatient ___ clinic for her Aranesp injections  \n\n# Lower extremity edema: R \u003e L lower leg edema, likely chronic \nin setting of SVG removal from R leg. No recent travel. No \nevidence of DVT on LENIS.  \n\n#. Asthma - continued albuterol and fluticasone and tiotroprium. \n \n\n#. Hyperlipidemia - started on pravastatin which was tolerated \nwell.\n\n#. Diabetes - diet controlled with diabetic/cardiac diet. HISS \nnot required for this patient.\n\n# Disposition: Patient was discharged to home with many \nmedication changes, including medications directed towards \nimproving her CHF treatment (imdur, torsamide, digoxin regimen \nchange) and had follow up with multiple providers. When nursing \nwas doing discharge preparations for the patient in the \nafternoon, patient was reportedly angry that she could not be \ndischarged at the time she was seen by the medical team in the \nmorning, even though it was repeatedly explained to her that her \ndischarge paperwork and medications needed to be organized and \nthat this would require some time. Per RN report, patients's \nhusband demanded that she remove the IV. RN removed IV with \nstrict instructions for patient to remain in room so she could \nreturn with medications and discharge instructions. RN returned \nto room 15 minutes later to find that patient and family had \nleft without discharge instructions or prescriptions for her \nmedications. RN informed discharging MD immediately who called \npatient multiple times at her home phone number at that time and \nthe day after discharge, instructing her on the answering \nmachine to return to the hospital for her discharge \ninstructions. MD's calls were not returned. Her prescriptions \nwere called into her ___ pharmacy listed in OMR, and this \nwas relayed to patient through phone messages at her home phone. \nThe sudden departure of the patient from the hospital without \ndischarge instructions lends credence to the fact that her \nmultiple admissions CHF exacerbations may be due in part to \nmedical non-compliance. In patient RN and MD staff made multiple \nattempts to contact patient and have been unsuccessful to date \nat the time of signing of this discharge summary. Patient does \nhave ___ at home, but should follow up with her outpatient \ncardiologist for medical reconciliation as soon as possible to \nprevent future hospitalizations.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nalbuterol 2 puffs q4h prn  \nplavix 75mg daily  \ndanazol 200mg 2 capsules BID  \nepoetin  \nfluticasone 110mcg 2puffs BID  \nfurosemide 120mg BID  \nmetoprolol succinate 25mg daily  \nnitro 0.3mg prn  \naspirin 325mg daily  \nMVI  \ntrazodone 25mg qhs  \ndigoxin 125 mcg qod  \nspiriva 18mcg capsule i inh daily  \ndocusate sodium 100mg bid  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Anemia likely \nsecondary to bone marrow suppression in the setting of sepsis. \nHe did require one unit of RBC transfusion on ___. \n\n# Abdominal pain and diarrhea. Patient with history of chronic \nabdominal pain and diarrhea. He has been C.diff negative. \nSymptoms improved on loperamide as recommended by his PCP. \nThyroid function tests were also within normal limits. \n\n# Schizophrenia/Depression: Paroxetine was discontinued. \nValproic acid dosing was decreased FROM 750 mg BID to ___ mg \nBID. Risperidone 1 mg BID was continued.\n\n# Essential Hypertension: Home amlodipine and clonidine were \ninitially held in the setting of hypotension on presentation. \nHome amlodipine was restarted prior to discharge.\n\n# Goals of care.

Likely related to \nknown PD duct stones and dilatation. Notably lipase neg, but \npatient reports this is frequently the case. PUD possible but \nalready on PPI. Note that adrenal insufficiency can cause \nabdominal pain and may  in fact be the etiology of her current \npain episode. MRCP with greatly improved pancreatic ductal \ndilatation. Per ERCP, no endoscopic intervention indicated. \nTolerated PO quite well. She will see Dr. ___ as an \noutpatient for outpatient lithotripsy. Patient was given a \nscript for pain meds to get her to her upcoming primary care \nappointment; non-opiate options insufficient. PMP checked.

Received insulin 10, dextrose and calcium. \nUnexpectedly this led to severe and persistent hypoglycemia \nthroughout the day requiring multiple doses of glucose despite \nfunctioning kidneys. Repeat lab check and EKG findings rule out \npseudohyperkalemia. Spironolactone could have contributed but \nsince has been on long-term this seemed unlikely to be primary \nfactor.

You were admitted for \nabdominal pain. We believe this is related to your pancreatic \nduct stones. We did an MRCP which showed that you did not need \nan ERCP or stent, which is good.\n\n******\n\nWe also found you to have a condition called \"adrenal \ninsufficiency\". It is not totally clear why you have this, and \nyou will need further workup as an outpatient to find out more. \nWe started you on a steroid (prednisone) to replace the hormone \nyour body is not making. \n\nMedicines\nAdrenal insufficiency is treated with medicines every day. \nMedicines can be taken in pill form or by injection, depending \non your need. Glucocorticoids: One type of medicine you must \ntake every day is type of steroid called a glucocorticoid. This \ntype of steroid (different from the “body building” steroids) is \nnecessary for allowing the body to metabolize fuel, although it \nalso helps regulate inflammation, stabilize blood pressure and \nhas many other effects in the body. Your medicines may be \nordered as:\n___ hydrocortisone\n___ cortisone acetate\n___ prednisone, or\n___ dexamethasone, also known by the brand name ___\n\n___ crisis can happen when your body's need for cortisol \nchanges and the amount you take is not enough. Signs of an \nadrenal crisis are: Nausea and vomiting Abdominal pain Severe \nweakness or collapse Headache, dizziness or fainting Change in \nalertness or confusion Fever and chills Low blood pressure Fast \nheart rates, or going into shock\nTreatment for Adrenal Crisis\nIf you have one or more of these signs, Dexamethasone can save \nyour life, so carry doses with you at all times. You should have \n2 or 3 prefilled syringes of dexamethasone. Have one at home, \none at work, and one you carry with you all the time. Keep the \nmedicine at room temperature. Avoid hot or very cold \ntemperatures, and keep it away from sunlight, and water. Refill \nyour prescription when you use a dose, after the expiration date \nor one year after having the medicine filled, or if the medicine \nis cloudy or colored .\n\nIf your fever is 100.4°F or higher, then double your dose.\n• If your fever is 102°F or higher, then triple your dose.\n• If you experience vomiting and/or diarrhea, then double or \ntriple your dose depending on severity. Take a double dose for \nmild to moderate symptoms and a triple dose for severe symptoms.\no If you vomit, wait half an hour, and repeat the dose. If you \nare vomiting and cannot keep the medicine down (vomiting less \nthan one hour after the dose), you need to administer injectable \nhydrocortisone (Solu-Cortef) or dexamethasone, and contact your \nphysician. Do not delay the injection; give the medicine first, \nand then call your doctor to discuss when you need to be seen. \nDrink small amounts of clear sugar-containing liquids \nfrequently.\n\nFor your safety, you should get and wear a medical alert \nbracelet or necklace that states you have Adrenal Insufficiency. \nApply for a medical alert bracelet or necklace. Wear your \nmedical alert jewelry at all times. Carry with you a wallet card \nthat has your doctor’s name, phone numbers, medicines you take \nand how to help you in an emergency. If you have one or more \nsigns of adrenal crisis, or feel sick, take a dexamethasone \ninjection, and call your doctor right away. Tell your coworkers, \nfamily and friends about how to help you if you have adrenal \ncrisis. If someone finds you unconscious, have them give you \ndexamethasone right away. Then call ___ for help.\n\n********\nYou are currently off of your spironolactone because your \npotassium is a little elevated and this medicine can worsen \nthat. You may be able to resume this soon after clearance by \nyour doctors. \n\n******\nYou are on opioids and benzodiazepines. We would recommend \ntapering one or both of these medications, as they are \npotentially very risky together for overdose. We are sending you \nwith a script for an opioid reversal agent if needed in case of \naccidental overdose. \n\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"}

Her pain may have been coming from GERD, so her \nlansoprazole was increased to 30mg TID and simethicone for \nsymptomatic relief.  H.Pylori was negative.\n.  \n# HTN: well controlled.  She was continued on atenolol, \ntriamterine/HCTZ, and her ACEI.\n.\n# Abnormal U/S: The patient was seen inpatient by her \ngastroenterologist, Dr. ___.  She was concerned that \nthe band-like pain she had across her abdomen was a passed \nstone.  An U/S showed an ectactic CBD extra-hepatically, which \ncould be concerning for a malignancy.  She also has two \npancreatic cysts which are being followed.  An MRCP was done.  \nAt the time of discharge, the initial wet-read suggested mild \nincrease in the size of one of her cysts, suggested follow-up in \n___ year.  The final read of the MRI suggests possible IPMN and \nsuggests repeat MRCP in 6 months.

Patient febrile, tachycardic and \nleukopenic on arrival with urinary vs pulmonary source and \nlactate of 4 and 20% bands on repeat Diff. His blood pressure \nwas close to his base line.  Initially broad differential was \nentertained and he was treated with broad spectrum Linezolid and \nMeropenam given his allergy history.  Patient received 3L IVF in \nED and 1L albumin upon arrival to the MICU. Patient had a \ncentral line and a thoracentesis upon arrival to the MICU.  \nPleural fluid demonstrated transudative per Lytes Criteria.  He \nwas subsequently found to have Proteus UTI.  Linezolid \ndiscontinued, meropenem continued until sensitivities came back \non Proteus, then switched to ciprofloxacin.  No further \nhypotension; in review of outpatient records, SBPs in ___ are \nnormal for him. He was treated with 7 day course of antibiotics. \nBlood cultures were negative. CXR initially showed no PNA; \nsubsequent study read as a new LUL density that could be \naspiration or PNA; however, pt remained afebrile, without cough, \nno CP, no leukocytosis, and 2 thoracentesis specimens both \nwithout evidence of infection, so it was thought unlikely that \nthe patient has a true pneumonia an dhe was not treated for \nthis.  Home midodrine for known orthostasis at increased dose of \n7.5mg TID was continued.\n.  \n# Right Pleural Effusion: During this hospitalization had \nthoracentesis x2 both showing transudative fluid, likely \nrecurrent hepatic hydrothorax as no evidence of focal \nconsolidation to raise suspicion for paraPNA as transudate via \nlights. Effusion re-accumulated after initial thoracentesis \ndespite titrating up diuretics.  After second thoracentesis, \nremained small but stable.  Fluid cultures remained negative.  \nBy definition at this time, his effusion is not refractory given \nit had re-accumulated in setting of holding diuretidcs.  If \neffusion persists/becomes by definition refractory, options \ninclude repeated thoracentesis, transjugular intrahepatic \nportosystemic shunt placement, pleurodesis, and surgical repair \nof defects in the diaphragm.  Continued furosemide 40mg and \nspironolactone 100mg daily.\n\n# Cirrhosis: No evidence of decompensation during this admission \nas LFTs at recent baseline and patient without encephalopathy.  \nContinued 40mg PO Lasix, plus 100mg spironolactone,rifaximin, \nlactulose.\n  \n# Normocytic Anemia. No evidence of GI source in the MICU with \nguaiac negative stool on presentation. Hct had dropped from high \n___ to 31 initially, likely dilutional in the setting of IVF \nresusciation + bone marrow suppression in setting of concurrent \ninfection.  Hemolysis labs with normal LDH, no haptoglobin \navailable, Tbili within recent baseline.  Hct improved from 31 \nto 38 and has been stable.\n\n# Atrial fibrillation. CHADS20/CHADS2VAS1. Currently patient in \nAF with rates in 60-70s. No anticoagulation in setting of \ncomorbidities and frequent falls.\n\n# Hyponatremia. Stable and at recent baseline; likely due to \ncirrhosis with vasodilation and low perceived circulating volume \nto kidneys, leading to release of ADH. Free water restriction to \n2L. \n.  \n# Protein calorie malnutrition: Evaluated by nutrition and found \nnot to be taking in enough calories. Dobhoff in place and the \npatient is tolerating tube feeds well, now at goal.  ___ was \nkept in the stomach (not post-pyloric) due to repeated \nplacements of the tube without success in post-pyloric \nplacement.  Given he was tolerating well, kept in stomach.  He \nwas monitored closely for signs of re-feeding syndrome. \n\n# Alcohol abuse: Last drink 2 days prior to admission.  \nInitially on CIWA but did not score.  Maintained on MVI, \nThiamine, Folate.   \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1. Citalopram 20 mg PO DAILY \n2. Midodrine 5 mg PO TID \n3.

There is continued enlargement of the \ncardiac \nsilhouette with bilateral pleural effusions and compressive \natelectasis. \n  \nImpression to the right of the lower cervical trachea raises the \npossibility of a thyroid mass. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ year old ___ speaking male with MDS/myeloproliferative dz \n(w/ poor cytogenetics) s/p Azacitidine x2, h/o pAfib s/p \nablation and currently not on anticoagulation, dCHF (EF 60%) \npresenting with fever and hypoxia. \n\n# Hypoxia: Initially admitted to ICU but transferred to the ___ \nfloor within 24 hours. H/o dCHF. Initial presentation c/w CHF \nand volume overload. Elevated JVD, CXR with pulmonary edema, and \nresponsive to Lasix - easily weaned off oxygen with diuresis. \nUnclear etiology of decompensation, no c/o chest pain. EKG \nwithout evidence of ACS/ischemia, ectopic atrial rhythm s/p \nablation. Likely 2/t weekly transfusions/chemo hydration as well \nas having Lasix held given concern of decreased PO intake with \nchemo tx. Another consideration was PNA given fever, but cough \nwas at baseline, non productive - given recent chemo, pt was \nstarted on Vanco, Cefepime, Azitrhomycin on admission. PE was \nalso considered but pt responded to diuresis while in the ICU. \nAntibiotics d/c ___ given no growth on cxs and no fevers \nduring admission, was saturating well on RA at the time. Did not \ndevelop a fever after discontinuation of antibiotics. Home Lasix \n10mg PO QD was restarted after IV diuresis. Dry weight appears \nto be ~118 pounds. NOTE: O2 saturations should be taken from \nforehead.\n\n# MDS/Myeloproliferative Dz: Poor cytogenetics with persistent \nblasts and transfusion reqs after Azacytidine. Recently started \non Decitabine but only recieved 1 of 5 days. Anemia and \nthrombocytopenia likely 2/t this marrow process. Currently with \n6% blasts. No clear evidence of hemolysis given normal \nhaptoglobin, but pt does have elevated t bili, mostly indirect. \nCould be 2/t ineffective erythropoiesis from underlying MDS. ___ \n___ in the past after chemo. Coags only slightly elevated. \nTransfusions scales were in place (hct \u003c21, plts \u003c10). Acyclovir \nppx continued. Given no infectious source (antibiotics stopped) \nand afebrile x72 hours, decision was made to give a full 5 day \ncycle of Decitabine under direct observation (with preceding \nsteroids to avoid a febrile reaction) - c1d1 ___. Pt \ntolerated the cycle well ???\n\n# Fever: Occurred after one day of Dectibaine. Initially thought \nto be reaction to chemo or PNA given hypoxia. Fatigue was the \nmain localizing symptom (cough was at baseline, dry). CXR did \nnot show obvious consolidation but was c/w pulmonary edema 2/t \nCHF. Repeat CXR after diuresis did not show evidence of PNA but \nresolving pulmonary edema. Pt does have a h/o febrile reaction \nto Azacitidne, admitted a month ago, no source of infection \nfound at that time. Pt was afebrile x72 hours, cultures were \nunrevealing (flu swab negative), and leukocytosis resolved. \nAntibiotics were stopped on ___id not develop a \nfever after discontinuation. As a result, reaction was likely \ndue to chemo and Decitabine was restarted with pre-ceding \nsteroids to avoid a febrile reaction.\n\n# Hyperbilirubinemia: T bili 1. 7 (mostly indirect), however, it \n___ been elevated in the past, specificaly after chemo. \nPotentially drug related as deciatbine is known to cause \nhyperbilirubinemia. Hemolysis is also a consideration but \nhaptoglobin was wnl, LDH was elevated. Could be from underlying \nMD, ineffective erythropoesis. No abd pain to suggest \ngallbladder process. Slowly improved during admission without \nmajor intervention, similar to when pt recieved chemo a month \nago.\n\n# dCHF: On Metoprolol and Lasix at home. Lasix was being held \ndue to concern for dehydration while recieving chemo. \nPresentation c/w HCF decompensation as described above. \nResponded to diuresis as above. Restarted home PO Lasix and \nMetoprolol once HD stable.\n\n# Acute renal failure: Cr of 1.4 on admission with baseline \n(0.9-1.2). Recieved fluids in ED. FeNa did not suggest pre-renal \nazotemia. Cr back at baseline after diuresis. Likely reflective \nof poor forward flow in the settin gof heart failure.\n\n# Paroxsymal atrial fibrillation: Patient is s/p ablation in \n___ and not on systemic anticoagulation given inability to \ncontrol INR levels. EKG difficult to intrepret but read as \nectopic atrial rhythm. Monitored on tele ___ hours and d/c \nafterno events. Restarted home metoprolol.\n\n#Gastritis: Chronic. S/p h pylori rx.

You were given \nmedications to remove the excess fluid and you improved. In \nterms of the fever, we thought that it may have been a reaction \nto the chemotherapy (given that it ___ occurred in the past with \nAzacitidine). As a result, we decided to give you Decitabine \nagain under direct observation preceded with steroid in order to \navoid a febrile reaction. You received 5 doses of Decitabine and \none blood transfusion with no further complications.

Low suspicion at time, as patient \nwas not complaining of lower extremity pain, no respiratory \ncomplaints, vital signs remained stable.  U/S returned positive \nfor DVT in R post tibial veins and L popliteal, post tibial, and \nperoneal veins.  Follow up CTA chest demonstrated multiple PEs \nin segmental and subsegmental branches of pulm arteries, \nincluding left upper lobe and left lower lobe.  Neurosurgery was \ncurbsided regarding whether it was ok to use anticoagulation \ngiven recent neurosurgical procedures, and they said this was ok \nwith lower PTT threshold (45-60).  He was therefore treated with \nheparin drip bridge to coumadin. He was continued on heparin for \n24 hours after his INR was \u003e2 and was then discontinued. He was \ncontinued on coumadin. \n.\n# Eosinophilia: Patient noted to have mild eosinophilia of ~900 \non admission.  Given fevers and rash, and having just recently \nbeen started on ceftriaxone, this was felt to be related to drug \nreaction.  Ceftriaxone was discontinued, and eosinophil count \ntrended down.  He continued to have mild eosinophilia throughout \nadmission but was otherwise asymptomatic. This should be \nfollowed up as an outpatient. \n.  \n# Altered mental status:  Was informed from rehab that patient \nhad altered mental status.  His mental status on presentation \nwas at baseline per neurosurgery and infectious disease doctors, \nwho had seen the patient on his previous admission.  His \nbaseline is somewhat alert, oriented to self and to year (___), \nand to who is president, but not oriented to month (thought it \nwas ___ or to place.  He is also quite slow in his responses. \n Head CT on admission, as above, unchanged.  Infectious work up \nas above.  Otherwise, neurological exam remained stable.  \nPatient's mental status remained at his most recent baseline \nthroughout admission and did show some mild improvement by the \ntime of discharge.\n.  \n# Subdural Empyema: Infected with strep milleri, status post \nnumerous repeat drainages on previous hospital course.  Head CT \non admission showed no progression of infection.  The patient \nwas being treated with IV vancomycin, ceftriaxone and flagyl for \nthis infection.  As above, given presumed allergic reaction to \nceftriaxone, this was discontinued, as was the IV flagyl, and IV \nmeropenem (at CNS dosing) was started instead.  He was also \nmaintained on his keppra for seizure prophylaxis. He will \nrequire prolonged therapy as detailed in his discharge \ninstructions.  His vanco started being dosed by level (dose for \nlevel \u003c20) following his acute renal failure. He should have \ndaily vanco levels checked until renal function improves.  He \nmay require an increase in his vancomycin dose with resolution \nof his renal failure. \n.  \n# C diff: Developed during previous hospital course, presumably \nsecondary to broad spectrum antibiotics for empyema.  Patient \nwas continued on PO Vancomycin, to continue for 2 weeks after \ncompleted course of antibiotics for empyema above. \n.  \n# Anemia: Hct 29 on presentation, which is at baseline - \nconsistent with anemia of chronic disease. He anemia slightly \nimproved over the course of admission but remained stable \nthroughout. \n.\n# Acute renal failure: Patient developed elevated Cr to 1.5 from \nbaseline of 0.___fter episode of low \nblood pressure. However, this was also ~ 2 days following \ncontrast administration for his CTA. He was treated with IVF and \ndiscontinuation of his lisinopril.  His Cr peaked at 1.7 and \nimproved to 1.3 by the time of discharge. Renal ultrasounds was \nunremarkable; urine and serum electrophoreses were pending at \ndischarge.  He continued to make excellent urine throughout \nwithout evidence of volume overload or electrolyte \nabnormalities. \n.\n# Urinary incontinence: He was incontinent of urine after \nremoval of foley catheter prior to discharge. He had no evidence \nof lower extremity paresthesia, acute weakness, or back pain; \nthis should be monitored for improvement.\n.  \n# Hypertension:  Patient on metoprolol and lisinopril on \nadmission.  Lisinopril was held due to acute renal failure as \nmentioned above.  This was held at the time of discharge, but it \nshould be restarted once his Cr returns to baseline.\n.  \n# FEN: regular (please note allergies to tomatoes, fish \nproducts, peaches, citrus, and eggs)\n.  \n# CODE: FULL  \n.  \n# COMMUNICATION: sister ___ at ___    \n \nMedications on Admission:\nMetronidazole 500 mg IV Q8H: stop on ___ then change dose to \nPO.  \nAcetaminophen 325 mg q6prn  \nInsulin Regular QID prn  \nPolyvinyl Alcohol-Povidone: ___ Drops Ophth prn  \nOxycodone-Acetaminophen ___ q4prn  \nFamotidine 20 mg PO BID  \nHeparin (Porcine) 5,000 unit BID  \nVancomycin 125 mg PO Q6H through ___ then change to Q8 then \nstop on ___.  \nMetoprolol Tartrate 50 mg PO TID  \nLevetiracetam 1500mg PO BID  \nCeftriaxone 2 gram IV BID  \nVancomycin 1,000 mg IV BID: Titrate to trough of 20 will \ncontinue to ___  \nLisinopril 10 mg BID  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Her EKG was unchanged from the \nprior EKG, showing a possible old septal infarct and no changes \nconsistent with PE. She had no chest pain and cardiac enzymes \nwere also negative. Her SOB is likely not related to MI. CXR \nshowed no pulmonary edema and BNP was also normal, suggesting \nshe had no CHF, even though her history of increased dyspnea \nwhen she reclines sounds like CHF. She has wheezes and \neosinophilia, suggestive of asthma, but she does not have a \nprior history of asthma.  Pulmonary hypertension would most \nlikely have a more insidious onset than her presentation. \nPneumonia is possible, but CXR is clear and her sputum is clear. \nShe was given albuterol and ipratropium nebs as well as a \nprednisone taper from 60mg. A course of azithromycin was started \non ___. ABG showed respiratory acidosis with metabolic \ncompensation and additional metabolic alkalosis likely due to \nlasix. Her shortness of breath improved on these treatments, \nsuggesting that her SOB was a COPD flare. Her outpatient \ncardiologist was contacted and wished to defer further cardiac \nworkup (likely a nuclear stress test) to the outpatient setting. \nAt the time of discharge, she was feeling at her baseline; she \nwas discharged with follow up appointments with her \npulmonologist and cardiologist and to complete a steroid taper.\n.\n#Microcytosis: ___ TIBC, ferritin, and TRF were normal and \nHCT was normal. Smear is consistent with Thalassemia trait or \nsideroblastic anemia.  Thought likely to be  thalassemia trait, \nbut further workup may be required.\n.\n#HTN: Continued HCTZ. Her blood pressures remained within normal \nlimits. \n.\n#CK elevated: CK is chronically elevated in Ms. ___. Troponin \nwas negative this admission. CK elevation is common among \n___ americans and also seen in hypothyroidism. Ms. ___ \nTSH is normal, so likely this is a benign elevation.\n.\n#Elevated HbA1c: HBA1c was 6.3.  Fingersticks were not elevated \non prednisone. ___ will check fingersticks.\n. \n#FEN: Low Salt diet\n. \n#Prophylaxis: DVT prophylaxis was with subutaneous heparin. \nCalcium and Vitamin D were given for bone protection with \nsteroids.

In terms of other infections, she had no resp \nsymptoms and CXR was negative.  LFTs were neg.  Her Ucx grew E. \ncoli which has been a colonizer.  Her CRP remained elevated \ncompared to her most recent hospitalization.  MRI demonstrated \nlikely chronic osteomyelitis.  ID was consulted to help \ndetermine a treatment plan given her medical complexity and \nhistory of poor adherence to treatment and ability to follow \ntreatment plans in the outpatient setting. It was thought that \nbest plan was to treat for the soft tissue infection and have \naggressive wound care. She was recommended to start \nlinezolid/moxifloxacin for a 10d course but she refused \nlinezolid for unclear reasons. She was trialed in house on \nmoxifloxacin (given her history of lip itching with cipro) and \ntolerated well other than some mild nausea. Her CRP trended down \nprior to initiation of abx, suggesting appropriate wound care \nwas very helpful. She was advised repeatedly about the \nimportance of aggressive wound care as being a necessary part of \nany solution to her chronic infection, and was set up with a new \n___ for daily wound care dressings (as she had previously not \nallowed her previous wound care ___ company into her house at \ntimes reportedly). She was intermittently not very engaged in \nwound care management and at times refused appropriate wound \ncare and frequently refused to straight cath herself, leading to \nurinary incontinence. Note QTc was wnl while on moxifloxacin and \nondansetron prn. \n\nSevere protein calorie malnutrition: \nVitamin D Deficiency:\nShe was previously seen by nutrition and will continue on ensure \nsupplements. Added back MVI, thiamine, ascorbic acid, and zinc \nsupplementation that were previously recommended even though she \nrefused last time.  Added vitamin D ___ units weekly. She \nrefused many of these meds. \n\nIron deficiency anemia / anemia secondary to inflammation:\nEvaluation for anemia neg for hemolysis previously. Previous Fe \nstudies showed low ferritin and low iron. Added supplementation. \n No evidence of ongoing blood loss. She refused this. \n\nAnxiety:\nChronic issue contributing to her distress.  She is on Ativan at \nhome.  Psychiatry was last consulted in ___ out of concern for \nself-care apparently, but she refused to speak with them.  We \nasked her to speak with this team but she is again refusing. We \nexplained that she does not have to take any medications she \ndoes not want to but just would need to have a conversation.  \nShe refused again. Lorazepam was continued at home dose.\n\nInsomnia: continued home zolpidem.\n\nThrombocytosis. Long term, likely due to chronic inflammation.\n\nPlease note that she declined most medications despite our \nstrong recommendations to continue these treatments, including \nheparin ppx.\n\n\u003e30 minutes spent on patient care and coordination on day of \ndischarge. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n- please continue to ensure pt is adherent with wound care and \nnutrition recommendations\n- monitor erythema around sacrum on antibiotics\n- after abx complete and if patient is able to adhere to \nrecommendations around wound care and nutrition, can consider \noutpatient plastics follow up with Dr ___ by calling \n___ at that time can consider multidisciplinary \ndiscussions regarding  possibility of surgical intervention for \nosteomyelitis\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

You were \nunable to safely breath on your own, so you were briefly \nintubated. You underwent a workup including MRI of the brain, \nwhich was normal. The most likely etiology was felt to be due to \nthe need for higher doses of your anti seizure medication. This \nwas increased to 1500mg twice daily. Please take your medication \nas prescribed and do not miss doses. \n\nYou will be seen in Dr. ___ clinic on ___ at 4pm.

Please review the \nseizure safety plan as below.\n\nIt was a pleasure taking care of you.\n\nSincerely,\n___ Neurology\n\n=======================================================\nSeizure Safety Plan\n\nPatients at risk for seizures that involves loss of \nconsciousness must avoid:\n- Driving (for 6 months after a seizure...\n            ...UNTIL A PHYSICIAN STATES THAT IT IS ___\n- unattended baths, unattended swimming,power tools, heavy \nmachinery\n- ladders, high platforms, roofs\n- any other activity that could pose a safety risk if there was \na loss of consciousness or uncontrolled body movements\n\nFor any seizure involving loss of consciousness, do the \nfollowing:\n1. Don't panic - take a deep breath\n2. Look at the clock to see what time the seizure started.\n3. If the patient is shaking for more than 5 minutes - or has \nrepeated seizures without returning to normal in between, call \n___ this is an emergency.\n4. As much as possible, move things away from the patient's ___ \nto avoid injury\n5. Use pillows or towels to protect the from injury\n6. Put them on a bed, couch, or the floor ON THEIR SIDE. This is \nto avoid a condition called aspiration pneumonia, when vomit \ngoes into the lungs.\n7. DO NOT PUT ANYTHING IN THEIR MOUTH. Patients don't swallow \ntheir tongues despite the old wives tale. However, putting \nthings inside the mouth could lead to choking hazard.\n8. When the seizure is over and you are sure they are safe, \nplease call the neurology clinic to let us know about a seizure. \n\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"}

Likely etiology of bradycardia is a vagal \nresponse to abdominal pain, but another possibility is verapamil \naccumulating in her system in the setting of renal failure \n(verapamil is hepatically metabolized, but the metabolite is \nstill active and renally excreted).  Throughout hospitalization, \nher heart rate remained in the ___ with no intervention.  \nHer verapamil held as an inpatient and restarted as an \noutpatient as it is beneficial for diastolic heart failure.  \n\n# PUMP: Patient has a hx of diastolic dysfunction (EF\u003e75%).  She \ntakes furosemide 20mg po daily and did not seem volume \noverloaded today.  By CXR, did not appear volume overloaded \neither.  Furosemide was held while she was an inpatient in the \nsetting of ARF but will be restarted as an outpatient at half \nthe dose (now at furosemide 10mg po daily).\n  \n# CORONARIES: Patient has a history of CAD s/p single-vessel \nCABG ___.  Her current sharp epigastric pain does not sound \nanginal in nature.  She has nonspecific TWI on EKG and negative \ntroponin x2.  She was continue simvastatin and ASA, but her \nenalapril was held in the setting of ARF.  She will restart \nenalapril as outpatient at her home dose.\n  \n# ARF: Patient's Cr of 2.8 is much higher than her baseline of \n1.2.  She did not appear dry on exam during admission (moist \nmucous membranes, is not orthostatic, skin turgor is good).  She \nwas also hyponatremic and hyperkalemic, both of which can be \nexplained by dehydration (hypovolemic hyponatremia and decreased \nK clearance with renal failure).  She received 1L NS overnight \nat 75cc/hr, which she tolerated well.  Her creatinine has \nimproved to 1.6 from 2.8 on the day of discharge and her \nhyponatremia and hyperkalemia resolved.\n\n#  Epigastric Pain: The patient endorsed sharp epigastric pain \nexacerbated by food, radiating toward back that began last night \nbut improved today.  Differential included gastritis, \npancreatitis, biliary disease.  Her LFTs were unimpressive and \nher pain had resolved by the time she was admitted.  She was \nmonitored without further interventions, and continued on her \nhome dose of Nexium 40mg daily.\n\n#Anemia: Patient is anemic to 26, which is stable but down from \nher baseline of low ___.  Iron studies were ordered on the \npatient, as pt has hx of iron deficiency, and the patient was \nstarted on iron supplemenation as an outpatient.  Her labs \nreturned after discharge showing an anemia of chronic disease \ntype of picture.  This was communicated to her primary care \nphysician who will make adjustments to her medications.\n\nChronic issues:\n#  DM2.  Her oral hypoglycemics were held in the hospital and \nshe was maintained on an insulin sliding scale.  Her blood \nsugars remained well-controlled.\n  \n# Dementia: She continued Donepezil 10mg daily per her home \ndose.\n  \n# Lower back pain: She was continued on Acetaminophen 500mg BID \nper her home dose.\n\nTransitional Issues:  \nCODE: Full code\nEMERGENCY CONTACT:  ___ (granddaughter) ___\nDischarge summary was faxed to patient's PCP, ___.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nASA 81mg daily\nVerapamil 120mg daily\nSimvastatin 20mg daily\nEnalapril 10mg daily\nFurosemide 20mg daily\nGlipizide 2.5mg daily\nMetformin 500mg daily\nDonepezil 10mg daily\nNexium 40mg daily\nAcetaminophen 500mg BID\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable \nPO DAILY (Daily).  \n2. simvastatin 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.  \n3. metformin 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO once a day.  \n4. donepezil 10 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).  \n\n5.

No masses or cortical lesions were\nidentified. \n\nMRI head ___:\nIMPRESSION: Stable appearance of incidentally noted right \nfrontal and left \ncerebellar developmental venous anomalies. Otherwise, \nunremarkable appearance of the brain, limited presurgical \nplanning post-contrast MR sequences performed only. \n\nCT Head ___:\nFINDINGS: The patient is status post left temporal craniotomy \nand partial left temporal lobectomy, with expected post-surgical \nchanges with overlying soft tissues and pneumocephalus in the \nresection bed as well as layering non-dependently along the \nbifrontal convexities. Scattered additional foci of \npneumocephalus are seen.  \nLayering hyperdensity along the resection bed (2:11) could \nreflect small \namount of layering blood. Hypodensity in the left temporal horn \nalsolikely \nreflects a small amount of blood. The residual left temporal \nhorn is \nhypodense, which likely reflects edema. No hydrocephalus is \nseen. There is \nno shift of normally midline structures.  \nThe prior MR demonstrated that the left lateral ventricle is \nasymmetrically smaller than the right; however, it may even be \nslightly compressed giving an even smaller appearance on the \ncurrent examination.  \n  \nIMPRESSION: Status post left temporal lobectomy with \npost-surgical changes as described above, with layering blood \nalong the resection margin and in the temporal horn of the left \nlateral ventricle and slight mass effect on the left lateral \nventricle.  \n\nCT Head ___:\nIMPRESSION: Status post temporal lobectomy with interval \ndecrease in the \ndegree of pneumocephalus without other change. \n\nMRI Head ___:\nFINDINGS: The patient is status post left temporal lobectomy \nwith expected \npost-operative changes including scalp swelling, a small \nsubdural fluid \ncollection, and hyperintensity on FLAIR at the margins of the \nsurgical site.  There is also slow diffusion at the periphery of \nthe left temporal lobectomy site. In the setting of acute \nsurgery, it is impossible to distinguish surgical trauma from \npossible infarction in these areas. No other abnormalities are \ndetected. The remainder of the brain demonstrates no evidence of \nhemorrhage, edema, masses, or infarction. \n  \nCONCLUSION: Status post left temporal lobectomy with expected \npost-operative changes.

He is anemic at baseline \nbut had no bone pain or hypercalcemia to suggest myeloma. His \nurine sediment was bland with no evidence of casts or dysmorphic \nreds, as reported by lab tech. His acute kidney injury was \ncompliacted by hyperkalemia, for which he received insulin, Ca, \nand kayexalate in the ED. Lisinopril and lasix were held while \nin-house. No urine eosinophilias were found. He received a total \nof 2.5L of supplemental IVF which greatly improved his Cr \ntrending down to almost near his baseline in 24 hours. Was \ndischarged with his Cr at 1.3 (baseline 1.2)\n\n#) DM2 c/b acute hyperglycemia: Patient on basal glargine, \npioglitazone, and januvia as outpatient. Had shoulder steroid \ninjection on ___ with a resultant hyperglyemia. Further renal \nclearance of glucose was impaired by the drop in GFR. No clear \ninfectious precipitant. Also possible to be related to \nmedication noncompliance as patient admits to not always \nremembering to take his pills. Normalized with insulin and \nfrequent FSG. LFTs wnl. Hgb A1c was still pending at discharge. \nHe will be discharged with a plan to increase his Lantus by 2 an \n4 Units if blood sugar is greater than 250 and 350 on fasting AM \nblood sugar respectively and to decrease by 2 and 4 units if \nblood sugar is less than 150 and 100 respectively with the added \ncaveat to call PCP if less than 100.\n\n#) Positive blood culture: One bottle from the ED grew out GPC \nout of 4. Patient is afebrile, normotensive, and feels well. \nHowever, he did have a leukocytosis on last labs, a history of \nan invasive procedure as well as recent steroids which could be \nconcerning. He received two doses of renally-dosed Vanco for \nempiric coverage. Given that his white count at discharge was \n13, and there is no clear infectious source, it is thought to be \na skin contaminant.\n\n#) Elevated Lactate: Likely from volume depletion and impaired \nclearance. Trended down towards normal with fluids.\n\n#) HTN/HLD/CAD equivalent: Hypertensive during this admission to \nthe 150s systolic. Lisniopril was held given ___, but ASA and \nsimvastatin were continued. All antihypertensives were restarted \non discharge.\n\n#) Asthma: Stable. Was continued on home advair, theophylline \nand albuterol nebs PRN. Flovent was held while in-house to \ndecrease steroid load. Will continue on it as an outpatient.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n[ ] Patient should check daily fasting blood glucose levels \nuntil f/u with PCP with the following titration for Lantus:\nIf blood sugar is: \n\u003c100, decrease Lantus by 4 Units and call your PCP's office\n\u003c150, decrease Lantus by 2 Units\n\u003e250, increase Lantus by 2 Units\n\u003e350, increase Lantus by 4 Units \n[ ] Should avoid NSAIDs in the setting of decreased renal \nfunction\n[ ] Encourage good PO intake and education on the signs and \nsymptoms of hyper/hypoglycemia\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \nfuther investigation.\n1.

You were admitted to the \nhospital after your blood sugar was found to be very high. When \nyou came to the emergency room, routine blood work also showed \nthat you had a significant decrease in your kidney function \ncompared to your normal. You also had a high potassium level and \na high white blood cell count. You did not have any evidence of \ninfection, and we think that your elevated sugars caused most of \nthese problems. As your sugars were more controlled and we gave \nyou some IV fluid, your kidney function and sugar levels quickly \ngot better. Your potassium level was treated in the emergency \nroom and caused you some diarrhea that also resolved quickly. \nPlease stop taking naprocin or any other medications like \nibuprofen, advil or aleve. It would be best for your kidneys to \ntake Tylenol when you have pain. We determined that you did not \nhave an infection and you were discharged home. Please take all \nyour medications as scheduled and keep your follow-up \nappointments.\n\nBest Wishes,\nYour ___ Team\n\nPlease use this guide when you take your blood sugar in the \nmorning:\nIf blood sugar is:\n...less than 100, decrease Lantus by 4 Units and call your PCP's \noffice that morning\n...less than 150, decrease Lantus by 2 Units\n...greater than 250, increase Lantus by 2 Units\n...greater than 350, increase Lantus by 4 Units \n\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"}

Despite her wishes to go home without 24 hour \nsupervision, she was held in order for this care to be \nestablished to provide a safe discharge plan. Multiple family \nmeetings were held with primary care taker, grandson ___, \nprimary team members, social work, and others. Ultimately, with \ngeriatrics and hospice liaison presence and aid, a plan for 24 \nhour supervision was instituted and thus, patient was deemed \nsafe for discharge home with services.\n\n# Leukocytosis: Persistently elevated from last admission.

Most likely urologic or \nintra-abdominal source. No cough prior to intubation despite \npatchy opacity in L lower lobe. Recent cystectomy at ___ with \nleukocytosis, fevers, AMS, UA c/f infection but to be expected \nwith new ileal conduit per urology. Per discussion with urology, \nnot clear that this is purely urologic source. S/p 4L NS IVF and \nvanc/cefepime in ED ___ ___. Lactate 5.5 initially in ICU. S/p 3 \nadditional L (1L NS, 2 L of LR) IVF in ICU and lactate improved \nto 2.1 by ___ @ 0700. Spoke to ___ about draining a fluid \ncollection around his surgicel in the abdomen at the site of his \ncystectomy, but they didn't feel that there was anything \ndrainable. Colorectal surgery recommended at CT A/P with rectal \ncontrast to look for rectal perforation as a source of \ninfection. The study was performed and there were no signs of \nperforation. The patient's fevers and hypotension continued \novernight despite continued treatment with Vancomycin and Zosyn. \nAt this point it was felt to be very unlikely that the fluid \ncollection was the source of infection given that the surgery \nwas weeks ago, and it would be odd for the collection to become \ninfected so far out. Urine culture was negative, so the \nkidneys/conduit were not felt to be a source. Bacterial \ntranslocation was considered as a possibility, though no blood \ncultures were positive at discharge. Because the patient was \nimproving clinically with stable hemodynamics and a lactate back \ndown to 1.0, ID felt that it was appropriate to stop micafungin \nand vancomycin and to just continue Zosyn. \n\nPressors at discharge: Levophed @ 0.08\n\n#RESPIRATORY FAILURE: \nIntubated on arrival to ICU for tachypnea ___, unable to speak \nin full sentences. CXR with patchy left base opacity but per \nreport no cough recently. Was on propofol/fentanyl for sedation, \npressure support ventilation, and extubated successfully on ___ \nAM. \n\n#COAGULOPATHY: \nINR 1.5 and PTT 51 from previously normal. Concern for DIC in \nsetting of septic shock, but platelet count was stable and \nfibrinogen was elevated. No evidence of hemolysis as haptoglobin \nwas elevated, LDH was low and Tbili was low. Likely secondary to \nthe patient's septic shock or antibiotic use, as his INR was 1.0 \non arrival so does not appear to be nutritional and there was no \nevidence of liver failure (His alkaline phosphatase was elevated \nand then came down with treatment, which was possibly from \ncholestasis of sepsis).\n\n#ACIDOSIS: \nInitially anion gap with a large base deficit, then non-anion \ngap. Felt to be a combination of the elevated lactate which was \nresolved and all of the chloride the patient received from \nnormal saline, causing a hyperchloremic acidosis (patients with \nileal conduits take up chloride in exchange for bicarb as the \nurine passes through). \n\n#BLADDER CANCER S/P RADICAL CYSTECTOMY: \nUnderwent procedure at ___ ___. Operative report in chart. \nUrology consulted and saw the patient in the ED, and their main \nrecommendations were to get colorectal surgery involved to \nevaluate for a bowel perforation. \n\n#ANEMIA: \nHgb 8.8 on admission, at previous baseline per ___ records. \nDropped to 6.7 on ___ AM. Looked dilution and gave 1U pRBC and \nthe patient responded appropriately to Hgb 7.8. \n\n#ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: \nCr 2.1 on admission, baseline appears 1.2-1.3 per ___ records. \nLikely pre-renal component in setting of sepsis, although this \nmay be the patient's new baseline as he remained stable at Cr \n2.1. \n\n#CODE STATUS: Patient urgently intubated on admission with \nconsent from HCP who is the patient's son ___ \nlisted HCP) ___. Per code status conversation on \nadmission to ___, patient was DNR, OK to intubate. At \npreparation for discharge, code status was re-addressed with \nHCP, particularly in-relation to whether the patient would want \nre-intubation should he develop new respiratory distress. HCP \nwas undecided about code status and wanted to readdress with his \nfather. Therefore, code status upon transfer to ___ \n___ was FULL CODE as agreed by patient's HCP. \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \nfuther investigation.\n1.

Patient has history of \nrecurrent urinary tract infections in setting of ileal conduit \nurinary diversion c/b L anastomotic stricture requiring L \nindwelling PCN (___). His recent urine cultures grew \npan-sensitive Klebsiella on ___, pan-sensitive E. Coli on ___, \nVRE on ___. He grew MDR pseudomonas in ___. He was most \nrecently treated with fosfomycin Q72 hours last dose on ___. He \nwas planning to follow up with ID to discuss suppressive \ntherapy, but he did not make it to appointment. Case discussed \nwith ID in ED and they recommended Meropenem given multiple \nmedication allergies and history of resistant infections in the \npast. Urine culture with colonic bacteria (sample likely taken \nfrom ostomy). Discussed revision of L ureteral stenosis w/ \nurology as frequency of UTIs has increased; however, patient \ndoes not want to pursue any surgical management, therefore \nurology signed off. ID consulted and did not feel picture was \nc/w UTI. Meropenem was stopped and patient watched off ABx. \nLeukocytosis and fevers resolved, but patient again became \nfebrile and developed leukocytosis on ___, this time with 127 \nWBC in urine that also grew enterobacter cloacae. Patient was \ntreated with fosfomycin, and then was started on fosfomycin \nprophylactic treatment on ___. \n\n# Bacteruria\nPatient chronically colonized, likely due to complex renal \nanatomy of ileal conduit and PCN. Patient was started on \nfosfomycin prophylaxis this hospitalization, and asymptomatic \nbacteruria does not require treatment. \n\n# Paranoia, hallucinations, delusions \nPatient endorsing auditory hallucinations. Feeling scared and \nunsafe. Initially believing that he was raped while in the \nhospital, but later acknowledging that this was a delusion. \nIntermittently refusing diagnostic and therapeutic \ninterventions. Was initially verbally threatening staff with \nviolence, but has since become more calm and cooperative, \nalthough did have continued issues with behavioral disturbances, \nyelling, and cursing.\n\nUrine tox positive for cocaine x2 (although patient denies use). \nSearched room given cocaine positivity and threats of violence \nto staff, which was very upsetting to the patient. On room \nsearch, found some home medications, but no illicit substances \nor weapons. In the week after the room search, patient \nvoluntarily told his nurse that he had found some of his home \noxycodone in his sock that he had forgotten about. This was \nplaced in the lock box, and due to concern that the patient was \npocketing his doses of oxycodone while in house, this was \nswitched to a liquid form. \n\nPatient continued to speak with pressured speech and was \nparanoid, at one point claiming to have been raped by staff; \nhowever, later noting that this was \"all in my head\" and that \nhis voices had told him this. Patient was treated with \nolanzapine, which was titrated to 10 mg PO BID with 5 mg PRN for \nbreakthrough agitation. On discharge he still reported hearing \nvoices, however he \"realizes these are fake\" and thinks that \nthey have decreased since he started the olanzapine. He was \ndischarged with home ___ psych nurses as well as olanzapine PO \nBID, with the plan to eventually taper as an outpatient at the \ndiscretion of outpatient psychiatry. \n\n# LUQ Pain\n# Nausea\n# Constipation\nPatient reporting LUQ pain on presentation. He declined a CT A/P \nin the ED. Pain began after a fall about a month ago, so may be \nmusculoskeltal in origin. Initial abdominal US was unremarkable: \ndid not show any evidence of splenic or hepatobiliary pathology. \nKUB ___ without evidence of obstruction but did show large \nstool burden. Patient eventually underwent CT, which again \nshowed large stool burden Abdominal pain and tenderness may \ntherefore be secondary to constipation. Patient was offered \nseveral medications for constipation, but mostly refused. He \nstates that he refuses bowel regimen because after the car \naccident he could no longer feel below the waist, and is \nincredibly embarrassed by frequent accidents. He told nursing \nthat he did manual disempaction every morning. This was not \nwitnessed by nursing or anyone on staff. He did eventually have \na few large bowel movements that were witnessed by nursing, with \nslight resolution of his abdominal pain, and nausea. He \nattributes the bowel movements to the liquid form of oxycodone, \nand is very resistant to taking the liquid oxycodone. He was \ncounseled about constipating effect of opiates and need for \nbowel regimen, and he was encouraged on discharge to make sure \nhe has a bowel movement every day. \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n========================\n# Sinus Tachycardia, resolved\nPatient with HR of 130 on presentation. Serum tox positive for \ncocaine. ___ also represent withdrawal, but patient and mother \ndenying alcohol use and tox negative for benzodiazepines. \nResolved to heart rates in the ___ on discharge.\n\n# Hypertension. \nVery hypertensive on presentation, likely in setting of \nmedication non-adherence. Continued amlodipine 10 mg QD and \nclonidine 0.2 mg TID, with improvements in his blood pressure to \n140s/80s. \n\n# Chronic Pain: \nChronic back pain. On home percocet ___ tab Q4H:PRN and \noxycodone 60 mg Q8H:PRN (recently prescribed by ___ \nCHA). Continued Tylenol ___ Q8hrs, Oxycodone 60mg Q8hrs, \nPercocet 10mg, q4hrs prn, and tizanadine 4 mg BID. However, due \nto concern the patient was subverting his oxycodone in setting \nof finding multiple pills in his sock this hospitalization, he \nwas switched from the pill form of oxycodone to liquid form, to \nimpede the ability to pocket pain meds. However as noted above, \nthe patient made nursing aware of the pain medications in his \nsock and states that he kept them there because he has housing \ninsecurity and needed to keep them safe. \n\n# Allergies: \nPt has multiple antibiotic allergies that limit treatment of \ninfections. Per pt he gets hives to all antibiotics listed. \nUnclear which allergies are true. Patient has outpatient allergy \nappointment to evaluate antibiotic allergies. Continued on \nloratadine 10 mg and flonase.\n\n# Normocytic Anemia: Baseline Hb ___.\n\n# ESRD: \n# Hyperkalemia\nStarted on HD ___. Nephrologist is Dr. ___. Pt \ngets HD TThSa. Received HD session in ED, as well as throughout \nhis hospitalization. He was continued on nephrocaps 1 QD and \nsevelamer 800 mg TID. \n\n# Insomnia: Continued on zolpidem 10 mg QHS\n\n# Nutrition: Continued on calcium, vitamin D\n\n# Anemia: Continued ferrous sulfate 325 mg QD\n\n# Seizure Disorder: Continue on keppra 1000 mg QD, 500 mg TThSa \nw/ HD\n\n# GERD: Continue on omeprazole 40 mg QD, which was increased to \nBID iso post-prandial nausea. \n\n\u003e30 minutes spent on patient care and coordination on day of \ndischarge.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n===================\n***NEW Rx of Olanzapine due to auditory hallucinations, plan for \neventual taper at the discretion of outpatient psychiatry team \n***\n[] Patient discharged to home with mother with psychiatry ___ \narranged. Likely will benefit from outpatient psych services, \nrecommend setting up with ___ where he has primary care \nto plan for eventual safe olanzapine taper. \n[] Mr ___ was started on prophylactic fosfomycin to prevent \nUTIs this hospitalization, and has follow up with ID ___.\n[] He has multiple listed allergies to antibiotics which are of \nunclear severity.

DIFFICILE TOXIN BY EIA.\n\n.\n==========\nCardiology\n==========\nTTE \nThe left atrium is dilated. There is mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is \nunusually small. Left ventricular systolic function is \nhyperdynamic (EF\u003e75%). There is a severe resting left \nventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right ventricular chamber \nsize and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No \naortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. There is systolic anterior motion of the \nmitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. \nThe estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. \nThere is no pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Small left ventricle with hyperdynamic systolic \nfunction. There is systolic anterior movement of the mitral \nvalve with a severe LVOT gradient, due to apposition of the \nvalve leaflet to the septum at end systole. Mild mitral \nregurgitation.\n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe measured LVOT gradient is similar to prior study (not \nreported on prior). The other findings are similar.  \n.\n===========\nRadiology\n===========\nCT Head \nIMPRESSION: \n1. Gyriform high density focus at left frontovertex, without \nassociated \nedema, mass effect, or gyral effacement, likely a chronic \nfinding. This could likely represents mineralization, related to \nold trauma or infarct. \n2. Air-fluid levels in the left maxillary and frontal sinuses \nand sphenoid \nair cells, bilaterally, with mild mucosal thickening in the \nethmoid air cells,representing acute-on-chronic inflammation. No \nassociated fracture. \n.\nCT Torso \nIMPRESSION: \n1. Bibasilar dependent consolidation with peripheral \n___ \nopacities worrisome for infection or aspiration. \n2. Marked enlargement of the left chest wall musculature and \nright gluteal \nmuscles. The muscles are overall lower in attenuation, \nsuggesting edema. \n3. Pancolitis, most proiminent of the sigmoid colon. \n4. Irregular contour of the kidneys. Exophytic right renal mass, \nmost c/w \nheamorrhagic cyst. Recommend US evaluation.. \n5. Intra-arterial right chest vascular line as noted on prior \nchest \nradiograph. \n.\nScrotal ultrasound\nIMPRESSION: \n1. Severe scrotal edema, with no evidence of fluid collection or \nabscess. \n2. Normal testes with small hydroceles bilaterally. \n.\n\nRIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND:\nThe liver is again coarsened in echotexture. The portal vein is \npatent with antegrade flow. There is no ascites. There is no \nintra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilation. The common duct \nmeasures 3 mm. No gallstones or wall thickening. \nIMPRESSION: No evidence of biliary ductal dilatation. \n.\nMRCP\n1. Trace fluid around the pancreas compatible with acute \npancreatitis. No \nevidence of fluid collection or biliary ductal dilatation. \n2. Small bilateral pleural effusions and trace ascites are \nincreased from the ___ study. \n4. Indeterminate lesion in the mid right kidney which has \nevidence of \nhemorrhagic components. This mass is concerning for malignancy. \nFurther \nevaluation is recommended. \n.\n___\nIMPRESSION: Normal deep veins in the right leg. Noncompressible \nleft common femoral vein is most likely due to edema. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n# s/p Sepsis secondary to Salmonella/Coag Neg Staph:  Resolved.  \nThe patient was admitted to the MICU intubated in septic shock, \nrhabdo, metabolic acidosis, ARF, and aspiration PNA, and was \nresuscitated with IVF and pressors. He received broad spectrum \nantibiotics, initially with Vancomycin and Zosyn.  A CT scan \nrevealed pancolitis, and Surgery was consulted and recommended \nconservative management.  Patient's blood cx grew out coag neg \nstaph and salmonella; group B strep was cultured from the \nsputum.  Antibiotics were tailored to CTX/Vanco/Flagyl. When he \nstabilized off pressors, the CVL which was placed at ___ \n___ in the R subclavian artery was removed with angio \nguidance by Vascular Surgery; a stent was deployed due to \nongoing extravasation.  The patient was weaned to minimal vent \nsettings and extubated successfully on HD 5.  Patient was \ntransferred to the floor and treated with a 10 day course of \nVancomycin and Ceftriaxone (later switched to cefepime - \ndescribed below), which was shorter duration than the total 14 \ndays anticipated because of patient's pancreatitis, \nhepatotoxicity, and rash (acute generalized exanthematous \npustulosis).  Patient had fluctuating WBC count during his stay \n(likely reactive), but surveillance cultures remained negative, \nand was afebrile and hemodynamically stable.  \n\n#. Transaminitis/Cholestasis/Pancreatitis:  Patient was septic \non admission and required pressors.  On admission, patient had a \ntransaminitis consistent with shock liver that improved during \nthe course of his admission.  Patient had been improving during \nhospitalization, but was noted to have an elevated WBC count \n(18) on ___.  Patient had been afebrile, hemodynamically \nstable, but there was concern for possible intra-abdominal \nabcess vs worsening colitis (noted on admission) that raised \nsuspicion for occult infectious process.  On ___, patient was \nnoted to have elevated amylase/lipase, elevated direct bilirubin \nand Alk phos, and was noted to be somnolent.  Given the \nmultiorgan system involvement, there was concern for possible \ndrug toxicity.  Patient had a Valproate level and Carbamazepine \nlevel checked as the doses of these medication had been \nincreased on ___ to his home doses.  These medications were \ntaped off over several days.  CT abdomen, MRCP, RUQ u/s were \nperformed and were unremarkable as to the etiology of the \npatient's hepatic and pancreatic involement -- no evidence of \nductal dilation or gallstones.  Patient's cholestatic markers \ncontinued to trend upward over several days and so hepatology \nwas consulted.  Hepatology attributed patient's cholestatic \npattern to Zosyn that he received in the MICU earlier in his \ncourse.  Patient's cholestatic markers have stabilized and \namylase,lipase were no longer trended when patient improved \nclinically. \n.\n#. C difficile Colitis: Patient developed C diff colitis on ___ \nwith a fever, increased white count, and tachycardia. Patient \nwas transiently re-admitted to the MICU where he received \nfluids, and was started on flagyl and vancomycin. Vancomycin was \nstopped (see below) and patient continued on Flagyl for planned \n21 day course.  \n.\n# Acute Generalized Exanthematous Pustulosis:  On ___ patient \nwas noted to have an erythematous rash involving his inguinal \nregion that was initially thought to be a candidal cellulitis.  \nOn the following days, was noted to be spreading, and was noted \nto be involving patient's trunk and back.  Dermatology was \nconsulted and diagnosed this rash as acute generalized \nexanthematous pustulosis, attributed to use of B lactam \nantibiotics in the past.  Patient was treated with emollient and \ntriamcinalone cream. Vancomycin oral was started in the setting \nof C diff and patient broke out in a new rash, so this was \nstopped. Rash was not nearly as severe as prior AGEP and \nresolved within 3 days.   \n.\n#Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  Patient was admitted with a Cr \nof 5, thought to be related to patient's septic shock.  \nPatient's Cr had trended downward to 1.5 during the admission, \nlikely secondary to ATN. Per his PCP, baseline ___ is around 1.4. \nAdditionally, patient reports known history if diabetes \ninsipidus due to prior Lithium use. \n.\n# Pancolitis:  Unclear etiology.  Patient was in septic shock \nwhen he was initially admitted and was noted to have pancolitis \non CT scan on admission.  It was thought that patient may have \ndeveloped this from hypotension, but unclear.  Of note, patient \nwas noted to have salmonella in his blood cultures.  Patient was \nfollowed by general surgery who recommended conservative \nmanagement.  A repeat CT Abd/Pelvis shows interval improvement \nin colonic wall.  Patient's PCP was contacted and faxed \ncolonoscopy records dating ___ years ago that showed normal \ncolon then.  \n.  \n#History seizure disorder:  Patient has a history of seizure \ndisorder and has been on carbamazepine and valproic acid at \nhome.  On admission, patient's home doses of these medications \nwas unclear and was started on low doses of each.  Patient's \npharmacy was contacted.  His home dose (as of ___) was \nCarbamazepine 400/600, and Valproic Acid ___.  Patient \nwas started on this medication on ___.  Patient was noted to \nhave hepatotoxicity/pancreatitis on ___, but it is unclear if \nthese medications are related to his state.  Patient had been \npreviously on these doses as an outpatient and had been \nrefilling regularly.  Neurology was consulted to help taper \nthese medications.  He was taped off over several days and was \nstarted on Keppra for seizure prophylaxis. He had a therapeutic \nKeppra level prior to discharge.  \n.\n# Bipolar disorder: Transitioned to risperidone in house and \npatient did well on this regimen. Psychiatry was involved and \nfelt that patient should have neuro-psych evaluation after acute \nmedical issues resolved, but felt that Bipolar was likely at \nbaseline at the time of discharge. \n.\n#. Hypothyroid: Thyroid studies checked in the setting of \nhypothermia and diarrhea. TSH 16, but free T4 normal at 1.2 \nlikely indicating sick euthryoid in the setting of patient's \nmultiple other medical problems. Plan to retest TSH as \noutpatient after acute issues resolve by PCP.\n.\n# RCC: Mass noted on MRI abdomen in house. It appears patient \nhas known ___ based on prior records from ___ and is s/p RFA \n___. Plan for patient to follow up with Dr. ___ at \n___ with plan for Q3 month CT scans for first year.\n\n# Contact: Brother ___. Cousin ___ \n___. Regarding HCP, patient has indicated that Cousin \n___ should be his HCP, however Cousin has refused. Patient's \nbrother is willing to be HCP, but patient is refusing. For now, \nif there are any issues, will have to use next of kin ___ \n___ for consent. Will need to readdress with patient. \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nMedications confirmed from pharmacy ___ ___\nCarbamazipine 400mg qam 1200mg qhs (last filled ___\nDepakote 250mg qhs (last filled ___\nSimvastatin 40mg qhs\nTimolol 5% opth soln to left eye prn\n\nof note, in ___ the patient was taking Depakote 500mg qam\n500mg q afternoon and 2000mg qhs\n\nPsych meds are being prescribed by ___ from ___\n___\n\nOther meds rx by Dr. ___ ___\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

You were found to have a very serious blood infection, \nlikely originating from your colon. You were treated with \nantibiotics which caused hepatitis and pancreatitis that \nresolved on their own. These antibiotics also caused a severe \nskin rash that improved on its own. You subsequently developed \nanother infection of your colon called clostridium difficile \ncolitis, and were treated with different antibiotics which would \nwill need to continue. Finally, your depakote was thought to \nhave caused some of your liver problems, so it was stopped and \nyou were started on Risperdal and Keppra instead for your \nbipolar disorder and seizures respectively. \n.\nYou are being discharged to a rehab facility to help you regain \nyour strength. \n.\nPlease seek immediate medical attention if you experience chest \npain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, nauasea, vomitting, \nfevers, chills, worsening diarrhea or any change from your \nbaseline health status. \n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"}

Lung volumes remain low. There is more focal patchy nodular \nopacity at \nthe left apex as well as in the right upper to mid lung which \nappears somewhat cavitary and may reflect known septic emboli \nwhich are now radiographically visible. More focal patchy \nopacity at the right lung base is also present and could \nrepresent a combination of compressive atelectasis, pneumonia \nand/or evolving septic embolic areas. The more rounded \nappearance to the right costophrenic angle is slightly less \napparent on the current examination but still could represent \nloculated pleural fluid. The heart remains enlarged but \nunchanged which may reflect cardiomegaly or pericardial \neffusion. Interval improvement in aeration at the left lung base \nwith no definite left pleural effusion identified on the current \nexamination. Stable mediastinal contours.

Cultures from the wound and blood grew MRSA and \npatient began treatment with vancomycin. A wound on patient's \nanterior left shin was incised and drained as well. He required \na brief ICU stay for respiratory distress but was never \nintubated. His fever and shortness of breath resolved and \npatient went to ___ floor. TEE showed no vegetations and patient \nwas discharged to complete a 6-week course of vancomycin.\n.\nACUTE CARE:\n.\n1. MRSA bacteremia: Patient had a perineal and buttock wound \nthat grew MRSA in culture and blood cultures that grew MRSA as \nwell. He was found to have radiographic evidence of septic \nemboli and was febrile with shortness of breath as well. He was \nstarted on a course of IV vancomycin. Patient received a TEE \nwhich showed no vegetations. He was discharged to complete a \n6-week course of vancomycin.\n.\n2. Perineal wound and other buttock and shin wound: Patient's \ninitial complaint was a tender, erythemetous wound involving the \nscrotum and perineum. It started off as a pimple-sized lesion \nand grew to involve a large area. Surgery evaluated and debrided \nthe wound because of concern for necrotizing fasciitis, which \nwas not present. The wound grew MRSA and patient recieved \nvancomycin and wet-to-dry dressing changes. The additional \nwounds on the left anterior shin and left buttock were incised \nand drained and had daily dressing changes as well. He was \ndishcarged with instructions for antibiotics and dressing \nchanges to continue.\n.\n3. Lung Septic Emboli: Patient had septic emboli to the lung as \nevidenced by chest CT. He showed no neurologic signs suggesting \nbrain lesions. Because of the lung lesions, patient had a period \nof respiratory distress requiring Bipap in the unit. This and \npatient's fever resolved with antibiotics and he did not require \nintubation. He was weaned to room air and previous pain \nexperienced with respiration was greatly decreased. IP evaluated \npatient for a small loculated pleural effusion associated with \nthe involved lung, and it was found to be too small to drain. \nCTPA showed no PE on this admission as well\n.\nCHRONIC CARE:\n.\n1. IVDU history: Patient was informed about the possibility of \ninfection with IVDU and he was made aware that the current \ndamage to his veins from this history interferes with vascular \naccess.\n.\nTRANSITIONS IN CARE:\n1. FOLLOW UP: Patient will follow up with the medical system \nwithin the department of corrections. He should receive follow \nup with infectious disease upon finishing the 6-week course of \nvancomycin.\n2. CARE TRANSITION: Per request of the DOC, patient will be \ntransferred to ___ to complete his inpatient care. \nhe should be continued on heparin SC for DVT ppx.\n3. VACULAR ACCESS: Patient has a PICC line placed. It was \ninitially placed 2 cm too far in as seen on CXR, but was \nretracted 2cm and is OK to use for IV abx now that it is \nproperly positioned.\n4.

The differential diagnosis includes an \ninfection process, sarcoidosis and less likely hypersensitivity \npneumonitis.  Dr. ___ has reviewed the case (H \u0026 E slides) \nand concurs.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n # Dyspnea: The patient was admitted for dyspnea and hypoxia. \nShe was initially requiring an NRB and was admitted to the ICU \novernight. She was thought to be volume overloaded and diuresed. \nHer hypoxia improved. She was found to be 84% on RA per her \nhematologist prior to admission. On transfer to the floor, she \nwas 89% RA, 95% 2L. During her hospital stay, her shortness of \nbreath improved subjectively although she still had significant \ndyspnea on exertion. She received albuterol and ipratropium nebs \nq6hours; no steroids or Advair. She was switched from Tiotropium \nand Advair to Combivent 4 times daily as her symptoms and \noxygenation appeared to improve with frequent nebs. Beta-blocker \nwas stopped to avoid bronchospasm. HCTZ was started instead for \nhigh BP. The pulmonary team followed her during her stay.  Echo \nshowed no evidence of systolic or diastolic heart failure. PFT's \nshowed obstrutive pattern with increased lung volumes and \nreduced diffusion capacity. Her work up included: ANCA- \nnegative; ___ 1:40 (negative); Galactomanin and B-glucan \nnegative; IgE \u003c2.0; absolute peripheral eosinophilia of 300; \nHypersensitvity panel negative. High Resolution Chest CT showed \ndiffuse multifocal ground-glass opacities in a predominating \nmosaic pattern, worse when compared to ___. The patient \nwas taken to VATS. VATS showed numerous non-necrotizing \ngranulomas c/w sarcoidosis. Vit D levels and ACE-I were WNL. She \nwas stared on Prednisone 40mg daily. She was started on \nbisphosphate and calcium w/ vit D. She was also started on \nbactrim for PCP ___.\n.\n# Purulent discharge from port-a-cath: On ___, the lumen of \nthe patient's port-a-cath was found to be draining discharge. \nThe IV nurse drew back from the lumen of the port and suctioned \nout yellow fluid. A wound culture was sent, found to have 3+ \nPMN's but no organisms grew. Blood cultures were sent were \nnegative. The patient showed no sign of systemic infection w/o \nfevers, leukocytosis or chills. As the patient had not used the \nport-a-cath for treatment in 6+ months, the port-a-cath was \nremoved at the same time as the VATS.\n.\n# Hypertension: Beta-blocker was stopped to reduce any \ncontribution to obstructive lung disease. HCTZ was started \ninstead. ACE-i was considered but the patient appeared to be in \nacute renal failure. She had no secondary indication for an \nACE-i.\n.\n# ARF: Baseline creatinine from OSH records appears to be \n0.9-1.0. On admission, she had a creatinine 1.2 which rose to \n1.5 then came down to 1.1. The acute renal failure may have been \ndue either to IV contrast or diuresis on admission. No further \ndiuresis was performed and her ins/out kept even.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nMEDS on TRANSFER:  \nLevofloxacin 750 mg IV QDAILY  \nAlbuterol-Ipratropium ___ PUFF IH Q6H:PRN  \nFexofenadine 60 mg PO BID  \nFluticasone-Salmeterol (250/50) 1 INH IH BID  \nTiotropium Bromide 1 CAP IH DAILY  \nLevothyroxine Sodium 100 mcg PO DAILY  \nMetoprolol Tartrate 25 mg PO BID  \nTricor *NF* 145 mg Oral daily  \nAcetaminophen 325-650 mg PO Q6H:PRN  \nCelebrex *NF* 200 mg Oral daily  \nDuloxetine 60 mg PO DAILY  \nPantoprazole 40 mg PO Q24H  \nColace/Senna  \n.  \n.  \nHOME MEDS:  \nfexofenadine  \ncelebrex ___ po daily  \nnexium 40mg po dialy  \nfluticasone/salmeterol 500/50  \ntiotropium  \ncymbalta 60mg po daily  \ncombivent  \ntricor 145  \nmetoprolol 25mg po bid  \nsynthroid ___ po daily  \n.  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

There is mild symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. There is mild \nregional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal \nhypokinesis of the basal to mid inferior and inferolateral \nwalls. Overall left ventricular systolic function is mildly \ndepressed (LVEF= 40-45 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal \n(\u003e=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased \nleft ventricular filling pressure (PCWP\u003e18mmHg). Right \nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \ndiameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are \nnormal. The number of aortic valve leaflets cannot be \ndetermined. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. \nThere is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). \nThere is no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The \nleft ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. \nThe pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. \nThere is no pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Regional left ventricular \nsystolic dysfunction c/w possible CAD. Normal right ventricular \ncavity size and systolic function. Mild mitral regurgitation. \nMild aortic stenosis. \n\nECGs with new bifascicular block (LAFB/RBBB) and some slight \ninferolateral ST depressions\n\nCardiac Cath:\nFindings\nESTIMATED blood loss: minimal\nHemodynamics (see above):\nCoronary angiography:  right dominant\nLMCA:  90% distal\nLAD:  70% ___, 95% mid. 70% ostial in D1\nLCX:  100% ostial. 60% ostial in ramus branch\nRCA:  Diffuse 90% disease\nSVG-:  SVG to LAD is widely patent.

Trops and CK-MB were elevated and \nECG showed new rate dependent RBBB.  Abdominal pain is likely \nher anginal equivalent.  She was started on heparin gtt for \n48hrs, plavix loaded, given full dose of aspirin and \natorvastatin 80mg. Her beta blocker was uptitrated to maintain \nrates in ___.  A TTE was performed to look for new wall \nmotion abnormalities and it showed a reduced EF of 40-45% (new) \nand regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction c/w possible \nCAD. Pt's pain resolved and CK-MD down trended to within normal \nlimits.  Coronary intervention was discussed with pt and decided \nto undergo cardiac cath which showed left main and 3 vessel \nnative CAD. One of her 4 bypass grafts (SVG to OM) is occluded. \nShe was managed medically and was discharged on aspirin, plavix, \nmetoprolol, lisinopril, and atorvastatin 80mg.  \n\n# Right bundle branch block: rate dependent. Discharged on beta \nblocker.\n \n# Hypertension: Continued amlodipine, clonidine and metoprolol. \nHCTZ was discontinued. She had episodes of hypertension to 170s \nwhen she was due for clonidine doses. One such episode was \nassociated with recurrence of her abdominal discomfort that \nresolved with her dose of clonidine and resolution of \nhypertension. ECG at that time did not show ST changes. ACEi was \nstarted for more consistent blood pressure control in the \nsetting of systolic dysfunction. \n\n# Congestive Heart Failure: now with decreased EF in setting of \nischemic insult. She was medically managed and discharged on \nASA, plavix, metoprolol, atorvastatin, and an ACEi. \n\n# Chronic kidney disease:  Baseline creatinine is around 1.3. \nShe was pre-hydrated with IVF before and after cardiac cath and \nher creatinine remained around baseline. \n\nTransitional issues: \n- Cardiology follow up \n- If ongoing chest/abdominal pain, consider evaluation with \nstress test\n- Code status: Full code, confirmed  \n- Contact: son ___, ___  \n\n \n___ on Admission:\n1.

His seizure event \nwas witnessed by his nurse (___) at ___. She describes the \nevent as follows: \"He woke after 8:00 am, was helped to the \nbathroom and returned to his bed. Soon\nafter she was called into the room and the patient was stiff in \nall extremities, eyes were open and his gaze was fixed straight. \nHe was not responsive to voice or tactile stimuli but was \nlocalizing to sternal rub. No jerking noted by her but the PCA \nnoticed some twitching prior to her arrival. He was turned to \nhis side\nand the episode lasted about 5 min. He closed his eyes and \ncontinued to be unresponsive for another 5 min until EMS arrived \nwhen he started to open eyes in response to his name. He had a \nsimilar episode on ___ but ___ his nurse was not present at \nthat time.\" In the ED he was initially drowsy and lethargic to \nresponse to commands, far from his baseline. He was given a 1mg \nKeppra load and started on 500mg BID dosing out of concern for \nseizure with post-ictal confusion. Impression was that his \npresenting episode may be a second episode of possible seizure \nwith a history of neurological disorder that predisposes him to \nepilepsy, warranting initiation of low dose AED. Within several \nhours, his mental status returned to baseline. He underwent \nroutine extended EEG which did not show any epileptiform \ndischarges (official read pending). His was not orthostatic \n(Lying SBP 121 \u003e standing 108, HR 84--\u003e71) He did not have any \nfurther clinical seizure-like activity but was noted to have two \nbrief oxygen desaturation events overnight, lasting less than a \nminute. Impression for his desaturation is likely related to \nrespiration/apnea vs nocturnal seizures. To facilitate event \ncapture, he was discharged with an ambulatory EEG to evaluate \nfor seizure activity overnight, which may warrant further \nuptitration of Keppra in the outpatient setting. Decision was \nmade to do this in the outpatient setting, as he expressed \nwishes to return to his home environment as soon as possible. \n\nTransitional issues:\n- Continue Keppra 500mg BID, may need uptitration pending \nresults of ambulatory EEG\n- Follow up results of ambulatory EEG, to be performed on ___ \novernight\n- Return to EEG lab at ___ ___) on ___ at 11 AM to \ndisconnect EEG\n- Follow-up with Dr. ___ next ___ months, we will call \nto schedule you an appointment, if you do not \n  hear from us, please call ___ to schedule an \nappointment\n- Continue all remaining home medications and PEG feeds as prior \nto admission\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

This event \noccurred after you woke up but was not associated with \nstanding/sitting and as such was not clearly correlated to \nchanges in blood pressure. This is your second episode within 3 \nmonths, which raises concern for possible seizures. Your \ndisease, Choreoacanthocytosis, increases your risk for seizures. \nAs such, we started you on a seizure medication (KEPPRA).  We \nevaluated your brain activity on EEG for 60 minutes and saw \nNORMAL brain activity without signs of seizure activity. No \nfurther seizure-like activity was noted and your mental status \nreturned to baseline within a few hours.\n\nWe monitored you overnight and detected 2 very brief episodes of \nlow oxygen.  This could be related to your breathing during \nsleep or possibly (and less likely) due to short lasting \nseizures during sleep. To better characterize these spells, we \nordered a 24-hour ambulatory EEG monitoring so that we can see \nhow you sleep and how your brain functions during sleep while \nyou are in your home environment.  You will need to return to \nEEG lab for removal of leads on ___ at 11 AM.  Your home \nfacility ___ at ___ was notified to arrange \ntransportation.\n\nYour primary neurologist Dr. ___ has been notified of your \nhospitalization and medication changes.

Interval appearance of mild pulmonary \nedema.\n\n___  ImagingCHEST (PORTABLE AP)\nAs compared to ___ radiograph, cardiomegaly is \naccompanied by\npulmonary vascular congestion and worsening asymmetrical \ncombined alveolar and\ninterstitial pattern which remains more severe in the right lung \nthan the\nleft. Observed findings may reflect asymmetrical edema, but \nfollowup\nradiographs after diuresis may be helpful to exclude secondary \nsuperimposed\nprocess in the right lung such as infection. Small pleural \neffusions are\npresent bilaterally.\n\n___\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is \nmoderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular \nhypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall \nleft ventricular systolic function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 \n%) secondary to pacing-induced dyssynchrony. Right ventricular \nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is \nmildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly \ndilated. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. There are focal \ncalcifications in the aortic arch. The aortic valve leaflets are \nseverely thickened/deformed. There is severe aortic valve \nstenosis (valve area = 1.0cm2). Indexed ___ = 0.5 cm2 per m2 \nBSA. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) \nmitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery \nsystolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___. \nThe findings are similar. \n \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ h/o stage IIA pancreatic cancer (recently completed ___ \ncycle gemcitabine), severe AS (valve area \u003c1.0cm2), Afib (on \nxeralto) VVI pacemaker for AV block is transferred from ___ for decompensated heart failure related to severe AS and \nNSVT, plan for valvuloplasty.\n\n#Decompensated diastolic heart failure related to severe AS: On \nexam he appeared volume overloaded with crackles and 1+ ___ \nedema. OSH CXR suggesting CHF. He was given 20 IV lasix BID at \nOSH and he was requiring 5L facemask (at OSH 2.5L). His O2 \nrequirement here was worsening and he was transferred to the CCU \nwhen he had to be put on a non-rebreather. There was initial \nconcern that the patients heart failure may have acutely \nworsened due to his aortic stenosis. Repeat echo was performed \nand showed a valve area of \u003c1cm and a preserved ejection \nfraction of 45%. The patient initially had been planned to have \na palliative valvuloplasty however on reevaluation it was \nunlikely to provide the patient with much relief given the valve \narea and mean gradient. The patient was diuresed with a lasix \ndrip and IV lasix  bolus of 40mg to which he put out well too. \nHe was diuresed with caution given his aortic stenosis. The \npatient was 92kg on admission and 88kg on transfer from the CCU. \n\n\n#Hypoxemia- Patient had presented to the hospital with dyspnea \nhad a new oxygen requirement. It was thought to be \nmultifactorial. This included aspiration, possible pneumonia and \nheart failure. The patient was triggered during his hospital \nstay for acute desaturation into the ___ and required to be \nplaced on a rebreather. His physical exam was notable for severe \nanterior and posterior crackles. The patient was transferred to \nthe ICU. He was kept on the rebreather and was not intubated \ngiven his code status of DNR/DNI. The patient was diuresed as \nper above. He was treated initially for aspiration pneumonia \nwith broad spectrum antibiotics which was discontinued as it was \nthought he was suffering from aspiration pneumonitis.  His \namiodarone was discontinued as it may have been resulting in \nadditional pulmonary toxicity. Given his prolonged hypoxia with \nminor improvement with the above actions the decision was made \nto consult pulmonary. The suggested further work up and possible \ngemcitabine toxicity. The patient was started on IV solumedrol \nfor 5 days. The patients oxygen requirement went down from \nrebreather to FiO2 80% on facemask. His crackles resolved on \nphysical exam. The patients Beta Glucan came back positive. He \nwas started on treatment for PCP with bactrim for 21 days  (___). The patient had daily CXR and LDH. High resolution CT \nscan was not performed as it was unlikely to change managment \ngivne that patients chronic pancreatic cancer.  The patient was \ntransferred to the MICU. The patient was given bactrim and \ncontinued on steroids with the thought that his hypoxia could be \nsecondary to PJP, however after 3 days of treatment there was no \nimprovement seen in the patient's oxygenation status.  The \npatient was maintained on nasal canula oxygen and a combination \nof high flow/non-rebreater/shovel mask with goal O2 saturations \n\u003e80%.  On the day of discharge, the patient was made CMO and \ngiven small doses of morphine and ativan to help with air \nhunger.  Patient was satting between 80 and 96% on high flow \nface mask. \n\n#NSVT: Likely due to myocardial strain from severe AS. Pt had \nmultiple episodes of polymorphic SVT since arriving to the \ncardiology floor. On ___, triggered for 1 min run of VT with \nloss of consciousness before spontaneously converting (normal \nlytes). His pacer rate was initially increased to 91 but \nsubsequently decreased to 80 in the setting of a worsening O2 \nrequirement. He was loaded with amiodarone. After transfer to \nthe CCY his amiodarone was discontinued as the patient had no \nmore episodes of NSVT and there was concern that the amiodarone \nmay be leading to pulmonary toxicity. Given the short duration \nof dosing it was unlikely to be causing pulmonary toxicity \nhowever given his fragile pulmonary system it was deemed safer \nto discontinue it. He appeared to be stable with the pacing at \n80. The patient was monitored after the amiodarone was stopped \nand did well with no repeat episodes. \n\n#Aspiration PNA/Pneumonitis: Pt had a witnessed aspiration event \nbefore transfer to ___. Otherwise he had been afebrile, had a \nnormal white count, and CXR showed small area of increased \ndensity in the RLL, consolidation could not ruled out. He had \nbeen receiving IV clinda at OSH and was switched to levofloxacin \non arrival to ___. This was further switched to ceftriaxone. \nWhen the patient triggered on the floor for hypoxia, the acute \ndrop in his saturation was thought to be due to an aspiration \nevent. The patient appeared to desaturate in the setting of \nhaving just received his medications. His antibiotics were \nbroadened to vancomycin and cefepime and the patient was made \nNPO. Speech and swallow evaluated the patient and deemed him \nsafe to eat. The broad spectrum antibiotics were discontinued \nafter 72 hours given that he was afebrile and stable. \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list may be inaccurate and requires \nfuther investigation.\n1.
