A nasogastric tube  terminates \noverlying the mid stomach with side port well beyond the GE  \njunction. A right subclavian catheter terminates over the mid \nSVC. The lung volumes are low. The cardiomediastinal silhouette \nis stable. There is  consolidation of the left base either \nrepresenting atelectasis or pneumonia.  There is a likely small \nassociated left pleural effusion \n.\nCT head ___:\nIMPRESSION: Bilateral temporal lobe edema with effacement of the \nsubjacent \ntemporal horns of the lateral ventricle temporal horn of the \nlateral \nventricles. There appears to be extension of edema into the left \nparietal \nregion with mild sulcal effacement. Images from outside hospital \nwould be \nuseful to assess for interval change. \nATTENDING NOTE: I think that the white matter hypodensity \ninvolves both \ncerebral hemispheres with predominent involvement of temporal \nlobes. \nConditions such herpres encephgalitis should be considered in \nthe differential but extensive involvement of frontal and \nparietal lobes is somewhat unusual. MRI can help for firther \nassessment. \n.\nAbd u/s w/doppler ___:\nIMPRESSION: \n1. Patent hepatic vasculature. \n2. Ascites. A mark was made at the left lower quadrant for \nparacentesis to \nbe performed by the clinical staff. \n3. Small right pleural effusion. \n4. Splenomegaly. \n.\nEEG ___:\nIMPRESSION: This telemetry captured one electrographic seizure \nwith \nonset in the left temporal region, which then spread to both \nhemispheres \nand lasted for about two minutes. The background activity in \nwakefulness \nshowed bursts of generalized slowing and occasional left \nposterior \nquadrant slowing. \n.\n___ CT-A Head:\nIMPRESSION: \n1. Normal CT angiography and CT venography with no vascular \nstenosis or \nocclusion, and no venous thrombosis. \n2. Unchanged diffuse hypodensity throughout white matter tracts \nsymmetrically involving both temporal, and, to a lesser extent, \nfrontal lobes. The findings are suggestive of cerebral edema due \nto a systemic or metabolic cause, including liver failure or \nrelated metabolic abnormalities. \n\n___ EEG\nImpression: This 24 hour video EEG telemetry captured no \nelectrographic \nseizures or pushbutton activations. Automated and routine \nsampling \ndemonstrated periods of generalized slowing consistent with an \nunderlying encephalopathy. Occasional periods of slowing were \nseen in \nthe temporal parietal leads consistent with more focal regions \nof \nunderlying cortical or subcortical dysfunction. \n.\n___ CT Head\nIMPRESSION: \n1. Unchanged diffuse hypodensity involving the white matter \ntracts \npredominantly involving the temporal lobe, also involving the \nfrontal lobes. The differential diagnosis includes cerebral \nedema due to the liver failure. Other white matter disease \ncannot be excluded. MRI of the head is the best modality for \nevaluation of the white matter disease and cerebral edema. \n2. No other acute intracranial pathology is identified. \n.\n___ EEG\nIMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no ongoing seizure activity. \nRoutine \nsamplings showed a background suggestive of an encephalopathy \ninvolving \nboth superficial and deeper structures and additional slowing in \nthe \nleft mid-temporal region. \n.\n___ EEG\nIMPRESSION: This telemetry captured no clinical or \nelectrographic \nseizures. The background activity was slow with additional \nbursts of \ngeneralized slowing suggestive of an encephalopathy and with \nfocal \nslowing and sharp and slow wave complexes in the left temporal \nand \nposterior areas. \n.\n___ MRI\nIMPRESSION: \n1. Abnormal T2- and FLAIR-signal identified bilaterally, most \nintense at the insular cortex. Abnormal signal also seen in the \nmedial and inferior temporal lobes, bilaterally. Findings raise \nthe possibility of herpetic or other viral encephalitis, though \nthere is no restricted diffusion or hemorrhage. \n2. Signal abnormality appears to involve more than simply the \nwhite matter \ntracts, with involvement of the insular cortex as well as the \ncortex in the temporal lobes. This more global picture again \nraises concern for previous hypoxic/anoxic brain injury, \npossibly with secondary acute demyelination. \n.\n___ CXR\nNasogastric tube terminates in body of the stomach and is no \nlonger coiled.  Endotracheal tube has apparently been removed. \nExamination is otherwise without change except for improving \naeration at the lung bases with associated slight increase in \nlung volumes.\n.\n___ EEG\nIMPRESSION: This is a normal routine EEG in the waking and \ndrowsy \nstates. There were no focal lateralized or epileptiform features \nnoted \n.\n___ CXR\nBibasilar atelectasis are grossly unchanged. Cardiac size is top \nnormal. \nThere are low lung volumes. There is no pleural effusion. NG \ntube tip is in the stomach. \n.\nDISCHARGE LABS:\nWBC 4\nHCT 31.5\nPLT 63\n.\nCHEM 10 entirely WNL\n(Cr 0.6)\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ y.o. female with Hep C and alcoholic cirrhosis, initially \nadmitted to ___ with variceal bleeding, \nstabilized endoscopically, but then developed altered mental \nstatus, presumed due to hepatic encephalopathy, and intubated \nfor airway protection. Subseuqently found to have cerebral \nedema, transferred to ___ for further care. Hospital course by \nsystem:\n.\n# Neuro: Pt had acutely AMS at OSH and was found to have \ndeveloped cerebral edema after her initial variceal bleed. \nInitialy, her AMS was attributed to severe hepatic \nencephalopathy. However, this was not typical for her, as she \nhad previously had relatively well-compensated liver disease. \nHead CT revealed the cerebral edema. Nonetheless, she was \ncontinued on lactulose and rifaxamin for any contribution of \nhepatic encephalopathy to her AMS. TSH was checked and was \nnormal. Also considered were infectious encephalopathies (ie \nHSV, bacterial). CT head upon arrival to ___ MICU revealed \nbilateral cerebral edema, primarily of the temporal lobes, most \nconcerning for HSV encephalitis. Due to her extensive cerebral \nedeam, an LP could not be performed.  Neurology was consulted \nand recommeded EEG and empiric coverage for HSV encephalitis \nwith acyclovir (10mg/kg Q8H).  No recommendation was made for \nmannitol initially given her sodium of \u003e 150, but when sodium \ndropped below 150 on ___, several doses of mannitol were \ngiven.  Serum Osm was in the low 300s.  Neuro recommended \nstopping mannitol on ___, and starting hypertonic saline \ninstead to reach sodium goal 150-155.  Sodium and serum \nosmolarity monitored Q6H. The MICU team also emperically covered \nfor bacterial meningitis with CTX/Vancomycin, beginning ___.  \nHer continuous EEG showed evidence of seizure activity at that \ntime, and she was loaded with Keppra and maintenance dose begun. \nSerial repeat 24h video EEGs showed no further seziures, \nalthough she remained intubated and on propofol. Serial head \nimaging revealed stable cerebral edema but no evidence of CVA. \nOn ___ a head MRI revealed not only diffuse bitemporal \nabnormailties as previously seen, but also extension into the \ngrey matter, concerning for prior anoxic brain injury. \nEventually neuro agreed with d/c'ing hypertonic saline and \nletting sodium drift down to 140 (but not below). When her \nmental status appeared improved, she was extubated on ___. She \nhad no subsequent problems protecting her airway, but remained \nforgetful and altered. A repeat EEG was ordered per neurology to \nre-evaluate for subclinical seizure, which was without any \nevidence of seizure. Her prognosis is uncertain as to recovery \nfrom her anoxic brain injury, and she is left with significant \nmental deficits (oriented to person only at time of transfer). \nShe is to followup with behavioral neurology next month.\n.\n# Respiratory:  Initially was intubated at OSH for airway \nprotection after she became confused, felt ___ hepatic \nencephalopathy, later felt to be cerebral edema (see above). \nHowever, was noted at OSH to have fever and grew MRSA in sputum, \nso was started on Vanco on ___ for a MRSA pneumonia. Also of \nsignificance, at baseline, the patient has hepatopulmonary \nsyndrome with PaO2 in the ___. At ___, her ventilator settings \nwere changed to ARDSNET settings, and her FIO2 was progressively \nweaned. VAP precautions initiated. Culture data remained \nnegative except for the MRSA in sputum from OSH and from intial \npresentation here. She completed a 2 week course of vancomycin \nand remained afebrile subsequently. When her mental status was \nfelt to be clearer, she was successfully extubated on ___. She \nis comfortable on nasal cannula at time of transfer. Note should \nbe made to avoid upright positioning for extended periods of \ntime due to hepatopulmonary syndrome and orthodeoxia. ******Her \nbaseline O2 sats are in the upper ___\n.\n# GI/Liver - Initial presentation to ___ showed \nbleeding ___ esophageal varices and she was stabilized with \nvolume resuscitation.  In total, received 13 units PRBCs, 12 \nunits FFP, 20 units PLTs at ___.  She had 3 bands placed \nby EGD on ___, and repeat banding x 3 on ___.  She was \nhemodynamically stable upon transfer and remained so in the MICU \nat ___.  She was continued on IV protonix ___ and monitored \nwith ___ HCTs. She was also started on post-GIB SBP ppx with \ncipro after her broader antibiotics (vanc/ctx) were d/c'ed once \nbacterial meningitis was felt to be unlikely. A beta blocker was \nadded for post-bleed ppx. Diagnostic paracentesis on admission \n___ was negative for SBP. She was not stooling initially; \ngiven lactulose Q1H until she began stooling.  Later lactulose \ndose tapered. Rifaximin added.\n.\n# ID - initially was broadly covered out of concern for \nmeningitis with vanc/CTX/acyclovir. She was also being treated \nfor documented MRSA PNA with vancomycin. When bacterial \nmeningitis was felt to be unlikely, the CTX was d/c'ed, but she \ncompleted a 2 week course of vanc for the MRSA PNA.

The slower and higher voltage activity in the \nleft \nfronto-central area is suggestive of subcortical dysfunction in \nthis \nregion as well as a breach effect and also because of left \ntemporal \nepileptic discharges suggestive of increased irritability in \nthis \nregion. \n.\nMRI head ___: Post-surgical changes status post left \nfrontal craniotomy with a stable appearance of the resection \ncavity involving the left frontal lobe. Stable nodular areas of \nenhancement along the planum sphenoidale may represent residual \nfoci of neoplasm versus post-surgical changes. No new focus of \nabnormal enhancement is identified. \n.\nMRI spine ___: 1. Progression of metastatic disease within \nthe thoracic spine, with an increasing lesion at T6. Focus at \nT12 may be an additional area of metastatic disease versus an \natypical hemangioma. \n2. Because the patient was unable to continue with the \nexamination, the \nlumbar spine, including the retropulsed lesion at L2 were not \nevaluated. The brain was also not evaluated. \n3. Multilevel compression deformities in the thoracic spine, \nunchanged since the prior examination. \n4. No evidence of thecal sac compromise in the cervical or \nthoracic spine.\n.\nMR ___ ___: \nProgressive metastatic disease throughout the visualized \nthoracolumbar spine and sacrum with new levels of involvement at \nL3 and L5. There is moderate intrathecal crowding at L3 \nsecondary to retropulsion from the pathologic fracture and an \nassociated epidural mass as well as severe narrowing of the \ncaudal aspect of the thecal sac secondary to the large S1 \nepidural mass. \n.\nCT torso: 1. No significant change in size of dominant right \nupper lobe pulmonary mass, with an increase in reticular nodular \nopacities throughout the right lung, which again may reflect \nlymphangitic spread. \n2. New bilateral pleural effusions, moderate on the right, small \non the left. \n3. Indeterminant cystic lesion in the upper pole of the left \nkidney, \nunchanged. \n4. Diffuse osseous metastases with progression. New destruction \nof the L2 \nvertebral body and retropulsion into the spinal canal for which \nan MRI could be obtained for further evaluation. \n.\nCXR ___: \n1. Right costophrenic angle not included on the image. \n2. Large right upper lobe ill-defined opacity corresponds to \nmass seen on prior CT, again highly concerning for malignancy. \nRight lung overall more dense than the left, which may relate to \ntechnique and patient's rotated patient position, although an \nunderlying process such as infection or lymphangitic \ncarcinomatosis cannot be excluded. \n.\nCT head ___: No acute intracranial abnormality. Please note \nthat MRI is more sensitive for evaluation for recurrent \nmeningioma or small brain lesions.\n \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nA/P: ___ M w/ recently diagnosed metastatic squamous cell \ncarcinoma, presumably of lung origin, with widely metastatic \ndisease to bone who presented to the ER today with word finding \ndifficulties, urinary incontinence, fever and increased \nweakness. \n.\n# Altered mental status/weakness/word finding difficulties: \nInitially concerning for delirium vs. infection vs. metastasis \nto brain vs. medication (dexamethasone) vs. seizure activity. \nPatient was empirically treated with antibiotics, with good \neffect and MRI brain showed no metastasis; blood and urine \ncultures remained negative. Patient returned to baseline mental \nstatus approximately 48 hours after his grand mal seizure. \nNeurology saw the patient and felt his weakness was due to \ndeconditioning and the spread of mets in his spine. EEG after \nthe grand mal seizure did not show further epileptic activity \nand in fact, showed some temporal activity suggestive of good \nseizure control on carbamazepine. \n- Continue physical therapy: Patient currently very \ndeconditioned and only able to sit up at side of bed and stand \nfor a few minutes. Also does not feel comfortable in the TLSO \nbrace. Please continue to encourage work with physical therapy - \ndoes not need to keep TLSO on if really does not like it. \nMobility limited by pain - please pre-medicate prior to physical \ntherapy (oxycodone, oxycontin, lidocaine patches to sacrum and \nleft leg)\n- Taper dexamaethasone per below \n- Continue antiepileptic medications per below \n- Patient requesting that Condom Cath be kept in place given \ndislike of coordinating urinal, going to commode. Discontinue \nCondom Cath as soon as patient sufficiently ambulatory or \ninterested in trying urinal again. Does not have incontinence or \nretention issues.\n.\n# Metastatic NSCLC: Appears to have progressive disease \nthroughout spine per MRI ___ performed in ED. Per Neurology, \nthis most likely explains his worsened back pain and new onset \nbilateral lower extremity weakness. Altered mental status with \nnew word finding difficulties also concerning initially for \nbrain mets but MRI brain within normal limits. Ortho-spine saw \npatient in the ED and was not concerned about cord compression. \nRadiation Oncology also saw the patient but felt he was not a \ncandidate for further radiation given his recent treatment \n(needs 6 month off for safety, healing). Patient was started on \ndexamethasone for management of his spinal met pain. His pain \nmedication regimen from his previous ___ facility was \nmodified (increased Oxycodone 5 --\u003e 10 every 6 hours) with some \nrelief of symptoms. In a family meeting with the patient, upon \nhis return to baseline mental status, his health care proxy, his \nnurse practitioner, his primary oncologist and palliative care, \npatient elected for ongoing palliative care instead of \nchemotherapy given his poor and declining functional status. \nPatient decided to change his code status to DNR/DNI. \n- Continue pain medication regimen as prescribed \n- Continue Dexamethasone taper as follows: Dexamethasone 4mg \nevery 8 hours X1 more day (___), then Dexamethasone 4mg twice \ndaily X3 days (___), then Dexamethasone 4mg once daily X3 \ndays ___. Then STOP. \n.\n# ?Post-obstructive pneumonia: Unclear given his initial CXRs \n(final read was malignancy vs. infection) but given patient's \ninitial hypoxia and altered mental status, he was continued on \nbroad spectrum antibiotics (vancomycin, levaquin, ceftriaxone). \nPatient's CT torso showed worsening metastasis in the spine but \nno localizing infectious source (including the lungs). Given \npatient's grand mal seizure, however, felt likely triggered due \nto an infectious etiology, patient was continued on his \nantibiotics for Vancomycin 5 day course, Levaquin/CTX 8 day \ncourse (for health care associated pneumonia). Blood and urine \ncultures remained no growth to date. There were initial \ndiscussions also, because of patient's decreased responsiveness \npost-ictally and his continued low grade fevers the first two \ndays of admission that he should undergo a l \n.\n# Seizure disorder: Patient was continued on his carbamazepine \nand gabapentin in-house. On second evening of admission, \nhowever, patient had a grand mal seizure and was given 1gram \nKeppra; ativan was not given in time as the seizure only lasted \n~1 minute. Per patient, his typical seizures have been grand mal \nalthough with a couple hours of post-ictal confusion/amnesia. \nAfter patient's grand mal seizure in-house, he remained \nconfused, altered (angry, contrary) for 24+ hours. Mental status \nimproved dramatically after that and patient was back to \nbaseline, per his health care proxy and nurse practitioner. \nNeurology followed patient in-house and recommended increasing \nhis carbazepine dose, continuing his gabapentin and pregabalin \nas is. It was felt that his increased seizure activity, despite \nserologies documenting therapeutic carbamazepine levels, was \nlikely due to underlying infection. MRI of the head was negative \nfor metastasis that had initially thought could be contributing \nto the increased seizure activity. \n- Continue Carbamazepine ER 300mg twice daily \n- Continue Gabapentin 300 every 8 hours \n- Continue Pregabalin 100mg before bed \n- Patient has an appointment with his outpatient neurologist, \nDr. ___ on ___ at 4pm. \n.\n# Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Once patient's mental status returned \nto baseline, he requested a CPAP for improved quality of sleep. \nCPAP was ordered with autosettings with good effect. \n- Continue CPAP as outpatient if possible \n.  \n# Code: FULL CODE --\u003e CHANGED TO DNR/DNI in further discussions \nwith patient, confirmed ___ \n \nMedications on Admission:\ncarbamazepine 300mg PO ___ Q AM, 200mg PO ___ Q ___\ncarbamazepine 300mg PO BID ___\noxycontin 40mg PO Q8 hours\ndexamethasone taper, last dose ___\nbisacodyl suppository daily prn constipation\nMOM 30mL PO daily prn constipation\ntylenol ___ PO Q8h prn pain\noxycodone 5mg PO Q4h prn pain\noxycodone 10mg PO Q4h prn severe pain\nlyrica 100mg PO QHS\ntrazadone 200mg PO QHS\nmiralax 17gm PO daily\ngabapentin 300mg PO Q8\ndocusate 100mg PO Q8\nsenna 2 tab PO BID\nMVI 1 tab PO daily\nomeprazole 20mg PO daily\n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Chest clear. \n.\nKNEE XR ___:\nRIGHT KNEE:  Degenerative changes are seen in all areas of the \nknee with \nosteophyte formation and narrowing of the joint space.  No \nsignificant \neffusions are present on this side. \nLEFT KNEE: AP views of the left knee is somewhat limited.  \nMarked degenerative changes with almost complete loss of the \njoint space are present in the medial compartment and marked \nnarrowing in the lateral compartment is also present. In all \nother areas degenerative changes are present.  No effusion is \nidentified.  No areas of erosion are seen. \nIMPRESSION:  Severe degenerative changes.  No evidence of \nosteomyelitis. \n.\nRLE US ___:\nFINDINGS: \nIn the skin overlying the right hip, there is a large \nsuperficial skin \nulceration with purulent material draining from it.  \nJust deep to this ulcer, there is a large fluid collection that \nappears \ndensely packed with echogenic mobile debris.  Its margins are \ndifficult to delineate with the ultrasound probe that is \navailable.  At the periphery of this fluid collection there is \nan anechoic fluid collection, which may correspond to the bursa. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \nThe findings are most compatible with an abscess deep to a skin \nulcer in the right buttock region.  The extent of this fluid \ncollection should be better characterized with cross sectional \nimaging, after which, aspiration can be performed.   \n.\nCT-GUIDED ABSCESS DRAINAGE ___:\nCT FINDINGS: \nPatient is known with a large superficial skin ulceration \noverlying the right hip.  Underneath this ulceration there are \ntwo linear collections \ncommunicating between them and going to that ulcer; the more \nsuperficial one contains a fat-fluid level and measures 11.5 x \n2.4 cm; the deepest one measures 13 x 2.4 cm, the collection is \nin the subcutaneous fat and goes up to the gluteus muscle.  \nThere is also a small collection in the anterior portion of the \nright maximus gluteus muscle (series 3, image 38) measuring 17 x \n27 mm. The greater trochanter lies just beneath the collection.  \nThere is minimal irregularity of the cortex but which is similar \nto the other side.  There is no significant sign of \nosteomyelitis. \nThere is significant degenerative change of the spine with \nanterolisthesis of L4 over L5 measuring 7 mm. \nMultiple gallstones are seen without sign of cholecystitis.  \nSmall and large bowel of the pelvis are unremarkable.  A Foley \ncatheter is in the bladder. The uterus is unremarkable.  There \nis a rectal and uterine prolapse. \nPROCEDURE: \nIt was decided to aspirate and drain the more superficial \ncollection which should be in continuity with the deepest one. \nThe procedure risks and benefits and alternatives were discussed \nwith the \npatient and written informed consent was obtained.  A \npreprocedure timeout was performed, discussing the planned \nprocedure, confirming the patient's identity with three \nidentifiers and reviewing a checklist per ___ protocol. \nThe patient was placed on left lateral decubitus on the CT table \nto access the subcutaneous right hip collection.  Under CT \nguidance, an entrance site was selected and the skin was prepped \nand draped in the usual sterile fashion.  5 cc of lidocaine 1% \nwas instilled for local anesthesia.  A 5 ___ ___ catheter \nneedle was first inserted into the collection where 30 cc of pus \nwas removed and sent to microbiology.  Then by a more anterior \napproach with an 18 gauge ___ needle, ___ wire was put \ninto the collection and 6 ___ catheter was then inserted. \nDeep sedation was provided by the anesthesia, please refer to \ntheir note for further detail.  There was no complication after \nthe procedure. \nIMPRESSION: \nCT-guided placement of a 6 ___ catheter inside the soft \ntissue abcess \noverlyng the right hip.  Pus was removed from the collection and \nsent to \nmicrobiology. \n.\nPATHOLOGY OF NECROTIC R HIP TISSUE ___: Skin with ulceration \nand gangrenous necrosis of dermal and subcutaneous soft tissues.\n.\nCXR ___:\nNew right subclavian line ends in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax, \npleural \neffusion or mediastinal widening.  Mild leftward mediastinal \nshift \nunexplained, since both lungs are well expanded and clear and \nthere is no \npneumothorax or effusion on the right.  Heart size normal. The \nstudy and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. \n.\nCXR ___:\nFINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little \ninterval change. Specifically, there is no evidence of pneumonia \nfollowing central line removal. There are low lung volumes, but \nno evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is an ___ with a hx ___ body dementia, AF (not \non AC), T2DM, who presented with recurrent fevers and R hip \npain/swelling. She was found to have a R thigh abscess/infected \nbursitis and osteomyelitis of the R femur.  \n\n# R thigh abscess, infected bursitis, osteomyelitis ___ proteus \nPatient developed a right thigh abscess in the setting of a \nlarge pressure ulcer on the lateral right thigh. Abscess was \nlikely present during prior admission (vs. superinfected sp \nbursa bx done on prior admission). Initially, fevers were \nattributed to sacral decubitus ulcer, and ACS was consulted to \nperform a bed-side debridement. Debridement on ___ revealed \na clean-based sacral ulcer, which did not probe to bone. Given \nthis, patient was scheduled to undergo US-guided biopsy of R \nthigh (swollen area on upper right thigh which was previously \nfound to contain sterile bursitis). Repeat U/S was concerning \nfor possible abscess. Pt underwent CT-guided aspiration of R \nthigh abscess under anesthesia (on ___ and surgical bedside \ndebridement of R thigh abscess (on ___. She also underwent \noperative debridement and bone biopsy (on ___. She was treated \nwith flagyl (___) and Vancomycin/Cefepime (___). She \nwas evaluated by infectious disease and, after tissue culture \nfrom bone showed proteus growth, she was transitioned to PO \nmonotherapy with Ciprofloxacin 500mg PO bid (day 1 = ___ with \na plan to continue treatment until ___. Nutritional status \nremained tenuous and pt's diet was liberalized. Patient was \nevaluated by S+S, who recommedned ground dysphagia diet until \nre-assessment at a time when pt was able to obtain her dentures. \nCalorie counts were inconsistent but, with family's \nencouragement, pt was able to eat large meals. She was \ndischarged with follow-up at Surgery clinic for further \nmanagement of the R thigh wound. \n \n# Sacral Decubitus Ulcer\nPt has a Stage IV sacral ulcer. As above, pt underwent \ndebridement by ACS on ___. Wound care nursing was consulted and \nrecommended instructions for care of the ulcer on discharge.  \n\n# Chronic Normocytic Anemia: \nHCT is slightly below baseline (30s to low ___. There were no \nsigns of active bleeding. \n  \n# Dementia:\nPt was A+Ox2.5 but intermittently not responsive during \ninterview. She was more readily responsive when family was at \nbedside.

Since he was in the hospital 1.5 months ago, he was \nput on antibiotics for HCAP vs aspiration PNA due to recent \nmultiple episodes of nausea/vomiting. Atypical PNA was also \nconsidered given the multifocal nature of PNA on CT scan. He \nreceived Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl and Levaquin, and was given \nboluses of IV fluids. Blood cultures, urine legionella antigen \nand urine strep pneumonia antigen were all NEGATIVE. . Patient \nhad persistent fevers while on medicine floor. Given \nimmunocompromised state on prednisone and infliximab, pulmonary \nwas consulted but did not suggest bronchoscopy as pt's symptoms \nand fevers improved shortly after Pulmonary consultation.  \nPatient's antibiotics were narrowed to levofloxacin only and he \ncompleted 7 days of antibiotics after his last fever on ___.\n\n# PULMONARY EMBOLISM:\nCT scan of chest on admission showed bilateral sub segmental \nPEs.  Patient was previously on dabigatran which was held given \nhis severe gastroparesis with retching due to bleeding risk in \npatient with low CHADS-2. After discussion with outpatient \nproviders it was decided to start the patient on warfarin \ninstead of a NOAC, as he has history of recurrent vomiting, with \nincreased risk for UGIB.  This is his ___ time VTE and appears \nunprovoked.  We recommend 3 months minimum of anticoagulation.  \nHe will need thrombophillia work-up and routine cancer \nscreening.  He had an echocardiogram that did NOT show any \nevidence of right heart strain.  He is being referred to the \n___ (multi-disciplinary pulmonary ___ clinic) and \nhas follow up scheduled in Hematology. INR on discharge 2.3\n\n# DELIRIUM\n# Altered mental status\nPatient was noted to have waxing and waning mental status, \nconsistent with delirium.  Unclear trigger for his delirium.  \nHead CT without bleed.  No new medications.  No evidence of new \ninfection.  No significant\nmetabolic derangement.  He was treated with a few dose of PRN \nZyprexa. He was seen by occupational therapy and was found to \nhave significant improvement in mental status. His mental status \nwas back to baseline prior to discharge.\n\n# FALL:\nWhile admitted the patient had an unwitnessed mechanical fall \nwhile anticoagulated. Patient was on telemetry when he tripped \nand no cardiac events occurred during that time. The patient \ninitially refused CT scans of head and neck and was able to \nverbalize and communicate the risk of intracranial hemorrhage \nincluding death. Patient's neurologic exam remained stable \nthroughout his hospitalization.  He ultimately had a CT Head \nthat did NOT show any bleed.\n\n# NAUSEA/VOMITING DUE TO GASTROPARESIS:\nPatient had extensive history of nausea/vomiting flares \noccurring 5x/year for the past ___ years. He has had extensive \nprior workup, including EGD, tryptase, C1-esterase, small bowel \nfollow through (SBFT); all were negative. He also had tried many \nmedications before this (amitriptyline, fexofenadine, \nerythromycin), which all failed. On admission, he was unable to \ntolerate PO due to gastroparesis. IV Zofran \u0026 Ativan were \ncontinued. ___ 2.5mg BID were continued.  He was seen by \nSwallow and SLP did not feel a video swallow or dietary \nmodifications needed.\n\n# ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS: \nContinued prednisome 5mg BID and calcium carbonate 500mg BID \nwith qmonthly Remicade injections. On admission, patient had \nsevere pain, so was started on IV dilaudid as needed. He was \nconverted to PO Dilaudid 2mg BID, which is reportedly a home \nmedication for him, prescribed by an outpatient MD. \n\n# AFIB: \nCHADS-2 score 2 (DM2, HTN), takes ASA 325mg at home. Was \ncontinued initially on home aspirin and diltiazem 240mg daily. \nWhile in the hospital, his home metoprolol succinate 100mg daily \nwas fractionated to metoprolol tartrate 25mg q6 hours.  His ASA \nwas reduced to 81mg once he was started on systemic \nanticoagulation for acute PE, as noted above.\n\nCHRONIC STABLE ISSUES:\n=====================================\n# T2DM - Reportedly steroid-induced. last A1C was 7.7 in ___\nContinued home Lantus, albeit at reduced dose given acute \nillness.  Mealtime blood sugar managed with SSI.\n\n# GERD: Continued home omeprazole, ranitidine \n \n# Depression/Anxiety: Continued home Fluoxetine 40 mg PO daily;  \n\n\n# Hyperlipidemia/CAD: Continued aspirin (reduced to 81mg now \nthat he is on systemic anticoagulation with VKA) and pravastatin \n40 mg PO QHS.  TTE this admission to eval for right heart strain \nshows preserved EF, no focal wall motion abnormality.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n1.  Repeat chest imaging with CT chest to document resolution of \ninfiltrates / multi-focal PNA, r/o underlying mass lesions\n2.  Dedicated MRI liver to eval abnormality seen incidentally on \nCTA Torso\n3.  INR monitoring and Coumadin dosing to be titrated, please \ncheck IN Rom ___. Goal INR ___.  f/u for PE with Hematology  Will need thrombophilia work-up, \nup-to-date cancer screening and consider Hematology referral for \nw/u of unprovoked PE.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Patient was transferred to the CCU for monitoring \nafter pericardiocentesis (no tamponade physiology on echo, \nprocedure performed for diagnostic purposes), who subsequently \ndeveloped fever and hypotension requiring pressure support with \nphenylephrine. He ultimately opted for re-focus of medical \nmanagement to pain management and positioning therapy and was \ndischarged to a rehabilitation facility.\n.\nACTIVE ISSUES\n# GOALS OF CARE: After significant discussion with both his \nfamily and his medical providers the patient voiced his desire \nfor re-focus of his medical management to control of his pain, \nand focus on comfort. These discussions arose in the setting of \ninitiation of permanent dialysis and prolonged and profound \nphysical and emotional decompensation. The patient stated he \nunderstood that termination of dialysis would not be compatible \nwith life. The patient was transferred to a rehabilitation \nfacility for management of pain and positioning therapy.\n.\n# PERICARDIAL EFFUSION: Echo performed on admission demonstrated \nlarge circumferential pericardial effusion, no evidence of \ntamponade. Since the patient had been having transient episodes \nof hypotension during HD sessions, and in order to better \nclarify the etiology of the pericardial fluid, a \npericardiocentesis was performed. Per report, 260 cc of yellow \nserous fluid was removed. Two hours post-procedure the patient \nbecame hypotensive, initially responding to fluid boluses, then \nrequiring Neo for pressure support. He was pan-cultured and \nstarted on broad antibiotics- vancomycin, cefepime and \nmetronidazole. It was noted that his pericardial fluid changed \nin nature from serous to cloudy pink thick fluid. He then became \nfebrile, and received more volume resuscitation for likely \nseptic shock.  Studies were consistent with an exudative \neffusion and culture grew vancomycin resistant enterococcus. \nBroad spectrum antibiotics were discontinued and daptomycin was \nstarted. The source remained unclear, given nothing on imaging \nto support contiguous spread, and highly unlikely that the \nprocedure introduced the organism. Furthermore, blood and urine \ncultures were negative throughout his hospital stay. A TEE was \nnegative for evidence of valvular vegetations. Repeat imaging \nshowed the effusion was resolved and the pericardial drain was \nremoved. He was treated with a 5 day course of Daptomycin before \nantibiotics were discontinued on discharge following the wishes \nof the patient.\n.\n# HYPOTENSION: The patient was noted to be hypotensive on \nadmission, thought to be secondary to hypovolemia from poor PO \nintake. He also had a recent history of transient hypotension \nduring hemodialysis for which he was started on midodrine. \nEchocardiogram revealed an enlarged pericardial effusion \n(details above). Post-pericardiocentesis the patient was treated \nwith fluid resuscitation and broad antibiotics for presumed \nseptic shock. His blood pressure was supported with \nphenylephrine. A ___ test was negative for adrenal \ninsufficiency.  Additionally, albumin of 1.7 so likely has poor \nintravascular osmotic pressure. Given his history of recent \nmedically-managed cholecystitis, and known intra-abdominal fluid \ncollections, a CT torso was obtained to investigate potential \nsources of infection. His HD catheter was removed. Surgery was \nconsulted to investigate possible cholecystitis (details below), \nand ___ performed a drainage of an intraabdominal fluid \ncollection, a hematoma. Serial blood and urine cultures were \nnegative. His hypotension resolved, and he was weaned off \nphenylephrine prior to discharge. His midodrine was increased to \n5 TID. Medical management was discontinued as the patient \ndeclined further medical management.\n.  \n# SUSPECTED CHOLECYSTITIS: The patient had a recent history of \nmedically-managed cholecystitis. On admission he was initially \ntreated with broad spectrum antibiotics, which were then \nnarrowed to Levaquin. Given our clinical concern for sepsis, a \nRUQ ultrasound was obtained and demonstrated a sludge-filled \ngallbladder and a small, unchanged fluid collection. CT torso \ndemonstrated stranding, concerning for acute cholecystitis. \nSurgery was consulted and recommended HIDA scan given low \nsuspicion on physical exam. HIDA scan was positive and a \npercutaneous drain was attempted; however, the procedure was \ncomplicated by collapse of the gallbladder (inconsistent with \nacute cholecystitis) and development of a small hematoma. A \ndrain was placed in the abdominal fluid collection, which \nappeared to be an old hematoma. Microbiology was sent and was \nnegative for growth. The drain was removed.  \n.\n# ESRD on HD: The patient normally receives HD on ___. \nRenal was consulted. HD initially was on hold given new pressor \nrequirement and stable electrolytes. Given concern for sepsis, \nthe tunneled dialysis catheter was removed and replaced with a \ntemporary catheter. Once stable, the patient received CVVH with \nphenylephrine for pressure support. Culture of the catheter tip \nrevealed no growth. A permanent catheter was not placed as the \npatient declined further dialysis.\n.\n# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION with RAPID VENTRICULAR RESPONSE: Present \non admission. The patient spontaneously cardioverted and \nremained in sinus for the rest of his admission. The patient has \n___ S2 score of 3; however, given his history of \nintraabdominal hematomas, we elected to continue aspirin 325 for \nanticoagulation. Medical management was discontinued as the \npatient declined further medical management.\n.\n# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Presented with CP in setting of AF \nwith RVR, found to have ST changes and elevated troponin \nconsistent with demand ischemia. Enzymes were cycled and the \npatient ruled out for an acute myocardial infarction. We \ncontinued his aspirin and statin. Medical management was \ndiscontinued as the patient declined further medical management.\n.\n# ANEMIA: No evidence of acute bleeding. Likely secondary to \nchronic inflammation. Is on Aranesp as outpatient. Hct trended \ndown initially on admission and was stable around 20 at the time \nof discharge. He required a transfusion of 1 unit of pRBCs with \nappropriate response.\n.  \n# THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Relatively stable. Unclear etiology, \nreportedly has chronic ITP, and is status post splenectomy.  \n.\n# PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY: Continued on gabapentin 100 qhs. \nMedical management was discontinued as the patient declined \nfurther medical management.\n.\n# GASTROPARESIS: Continued on metoclopramide 5 mg PO QIDACHS. \nMedical management was discontinued as the patient declined \nfurther medical management.\n.\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n- ___ Management: Management of pain and optimization of \npositional comfort.\n- Pending Studies: Pericardial and Abdominal Fluid Cytology, \nfinalized culture data\n- Code Status: DNR/DNI, do not resuscitate.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nacetaminophen 325 mg Tablet PO Q6H PRN  \nMOM prn constipation  \nsimvastatin 40 mg Tablet PO DAILY  \nallopurinol ___ mg Tablet Sig:PO DAILY  \npantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release PO Q24H  \ndocusate sodium 100 mg BID  \nsenna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: PO BID  \ntramadol 50 mg PO Q12H  \nmetoclopramide 10 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO QIDACHS  \npolyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose DAILY (Daily).  \nmidodrine 2.5 mg Tablet 6A 11A 4p  \nsimethicone 80 mg Tablet, QID as needed for gas.  \ngabapentin 100 mg HS  \nB complex-vitamin C-folic acid 1 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Cap  \nPO DAILY (Daily).  \npolyvinyl alcohol-povidone 1.4-0.6 % Dropperette Sig: ___  \nDrops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eyes.  \nlevothyroxine 125 mcg DAILY  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

There is mild regional \nleft ventricular systolic dysfunction with mild hypokinesis of \nthe basal inferior septum and inferior walls (see schematic) and \npreserved/normal contractility of the remaining segments. The \nvisually estimated left ventricular ejection fraction is 55-60%. \nLeft ventricular cardiac index is low normal (2.0-2.5 L/min/m2). \nThere is no resting left ventricular outflow tract gradient. No \nventricular septal defect is seen. Normal right ventricular \ncavity size with normal free wall motion. The aortic sinus \ndiameter is normal for gender with normal ascending aorta \ndiameter for gender. The aortic arch diameter is normal. The \naortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is no \naortic valve stenosis. There is no aortic regurgitation. The \nmitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened with tethering of the \nposterior mitral leaflet with no mitral valve prolapse. The \ntethering could be a mild form on rheumatic valve disease, but \nnot definitive. Anterior leaflet excursion is normal. There is \nan eccentric, inferolateral directed jet of mild [1+] mitral \nregurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear structurally \nnormal. There is physiologic tricuspid regurgitation. The \nestimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is \nno pericardial effusion. There is a prominent anterior fat pad.\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with \nmild regional systolic dysfunction most consistent with coronary \nartery disease.

He was found confused, then suddenly collapsed \nper his wife earlier today.  He was taken to ___ \n___, where head CT showed an ICH. He was intubated, loaded \nwith phosphenytoin \u0026 treated with vitamin K for presumed \ncoagulopathy; then transferred to ___ for surgical management \nof his ICH.\n.\nUpon transfer from the outside hospital, the patient was \ninitially evaluated by the neurosurgery service in regards to a \npossible right temporoparietal craniotomy.  In lengthy \ndiscussion with the neurosurgery service and neurology service, \nthe family decided against surgical intervention as they did not \nwant the patient to suffer.  \n.\nThe neurology service was asked to see him urgently by \nNeurosurgery to assist with ICH management and to render our \nopinion regarding the futility of surgical intervention.  At \ntime of examination, the patient had no spontaneous movement and \ndid not respond to voice.  He had a mild gag reflex. Pupils were \nsmall ~ 1 to 1.5 mm but reactive.  Eyes were midline.  He had \ncorneals bilaterally.  Doll's eye was not elicited.  He moved \nthe right side to pain \u0026 nasal stimulation. He postures on the \nleft in response to pain.  Toes were upgoing. Overall, his GCS \nwas 4.  Head CT showed a large right parenchymal ICH with IVH \nand extension into the brainstem, midline shift of ~ 22mm, and \nventricular dilatation in addition to an old left\ntemporo-parietal infarct. \n.\nOverall, the cause of his ICH was difficult to ascertain.  It is \nlikely hypertensive, but one cannot entirely rule out a \nsecondary cause.  Regardless, his prognosis appeared grim. His \nICH score was 4, indicating a 30-day mortality of ~ 97%.  \nMultiple members of the neurology and neurosurgery service had \nlengthy discussions with multiple family members regarding his \ncondition, expected prognosis, and treatment options.  His \nchances for any meaningful recovery, if he survives, are \nminimal.  While surgery could be life-saving, it is unlikely to \nimprove his functional outcome. They decided on a DNR status, \nbut wanted to\ndiscuss the surgical option with Dr. ___ further.  They \nwere initially inclined to proceed with surgery, but later \nreversed their decision.\n.\nThe patient was admitted to the NSICU for medical management.  A \nrepeat CT head several hours after arrival revealed worsening \nhemorrhage with midline shift and uncal herniation.

The peak estimated metabolic capacity was ___ METs, an \naverage\nfunctional capacity for age. There were no chest, arm, neck or \nback\ndiscomforts reported by the patient throughout the study. There \nwere\nno ischemic ECG changes. The rhythm was sinus with rare PVCs. \nThere\nwere two episodes of dyspnea in recovery accompanied by frequent \nPACs.\nThe blood pressure and heart rate responses to exercise were\nappropriate.\n \nIMPRESSION: No anginal type symptoms with dyspnea and PACs in \nrecovery.\nNo ischemic ECG changes to the average workload achieved. \nAppropriate\nhemodynamic response.\n\n___ TTE\nThe left atrial volume index is normal. Normal left ventricular \nwall thickness, cavity size, and regional/global systolic \nfunction (biplane LVEF = 67 %). The estimated cardiac index is \nnormal (\u003e=2.5L/min/m2). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an \nincreased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP\u003e18mmHg). Right \nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \naortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good \nleaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic \nregurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with \ntrivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse. \nThere is borderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. \nThere is a small circumferential pericardial effusion without \nechocardiographic signs of tamponade. \n\nIMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved \nregional and global biventricular systolic function.

There are bilateral low lung volumes, \nbut no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Left basilar linear \nopacity is most compatible with atelectasis, less likely \nsequelae of aspiration. Bones appear intact.  \nIMPRESSION: Left basilar linear opacity, likely atelectasis. \n\n- CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Evaluation is limited due to the lack of IV \ncontrast. The spleen measures up to 13.8 cm which is slightly \nelevated in size and appears increased since the previous study. \nNon-contrast appearance of the kidneys is within normal limits. \nThe adrenal glands, liver, pancreas, and stomach are within \nnormal limits. Slightly hyperdense material noted within the \ngallbladder may represent sludge or tiny gallstones. The \ngallbladder is not distended. The retroperitoneal and mesenteric \nfat demonstrates prominent stranding, although this may be due \nto third-space fluid distribution. The stranding includes the \nperipancreatic region, so early pancreatitis is not excluded, \nthough the changes are not centered about the pancreas. Small \nretroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes are noted, although \nnone meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.  The \nintra-abdominal loops of bowel are within normal limits. There \nis no \nobstruction. Patient is status post colectomy with loop \nileostomy in the right lower quadrant. There is no evidence of \nhernia or obstruction. At the lung bases, again seen is an area \nof spiculated-appearing opacity in \nthe peribronchiolar distribution at the left lung base (2:7). \nThis appears \nslightly more prominent than on previous study of ___. A small area of subpleural septal thickening is seen (2;5) \nin the right middle lobe. This may be post inflammatory, but a \nsmall area of interstitial fibrosis is possible. Minor scarring \nor atelectasis is noted within the lingula. Hilar and \nmediastinal lymphadenopathy is again seen, although incompletely \nvisualized on this study. The visualized lymphadenopathy also \nappears to have increased in size since the previous study with \na node inferior to right bronchus now measuring 1.4cm in short \naxis versus 1cm on prior study. There is no pleural effusion. \nThe heart size is normal. \n- CT OF THE PELVIS: Suture material is noted from prior \ncolectomy in the rectum. A Foley catheter is noted within a \ndecompressed bladder. No free fluid is noted within the pelvis. \nThere is no inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy. \n- BONE WINDOWS: No concerning osseous lesions are identified. \nIMPRESSION: \n1. Similar basal chest findings, with slight increased \nprominence of left lower lobe spiculated opacity. Minimal \npossible right middle lobe subpleural interstitial abnormality. \nSplenomegaly. As previously described, these findings could be \nseen in sarcoidosis, though neoplasm is not excluded at the left \nlung base. \n2. Increased size of visualized portion of mediastinal \nlymphadenopathy. \n3. Hyperdense material within the gallbladder, which is new \nsince the previous study and may represent sludge.\n4. Stranding throughout the mesenteric fat and retroperitoneal \nfat which may be due to patient's fluid status. This includes \nthe peripancreatic region so early pancreatitis is difficult to \nexclude - clinical correlation is advised. \n5 Status post colectomy with ileostomy in the right lower \nquadrant. No evidence of hernia or obstruction.  \n\nScrotal US ___\n\n1. Findings suggestive of right-sided orchitis and epididymitis; \nof note there \nis a surrounding thin rim of hyperechoic material but without \nmobility of \nechotexture likely to represent liquefaction; this may represent \nphlegmonous \nchange in the scrotal sac, however. \n  \n2. Left testicular microlithiasis. Recommend clinical followup \nand ultrasound \nin ___ year to document stability, as this may be associated with \nincreased \ntesticular neoplasm. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nSpiculated LLL lung mass had increased in size compared to \nprevious imaging.  Pt requires follow up for further evaluation \nof this lung mass as it may be independent process of hilar \nlymphadenopathy.  Pt was notified on ___ that the mass had \nincreased in size and it is unclear as to its etiology, but it \nis an unusual presentation for sarcoid.  He said that he and his \nphysicians planned to work this mass up further, but his \nsurgical intervention was a priority.  Please make sure the \npatient follows up for further evaluation in the future.\n\n___ yo M w/ h/o sarcoidosis, HTN, DM, recently dx rectal \nadenocarcinoma s/p laparoscopic low anterior resection w/ \ncoloanal anastamosis and ileostomy on ___, p/w pain at the \nostomy site, chills, low grade temps x 3 days, urine cx from \n___ positive for ___ transferred to ___ for sepsis.\n\n#  Septic Shock, supported by hypotension, leukocytosis with \nbandemia, and elevated lactate.  Unclear source.  Initial \nthought of the infectious source is the urine given prior \npositive pan-sensitive pseudomonas, however, Ucx was negative.  \nLess likely from pneumonia given lack of clinical symptoms and \nnegative abscess on abdominal scan.  Unlikely a biliary source \ngiven normal LFTs despite some evidence of biliary sludge.  \nBlood cultures also have been NGTD????.  Unlikely adrenal \ninsufficient from the brief prednisone course ___ days in \n___ and cortisol level was normal.  Patient was started on \ncefepime, ciprofloxacin, Flagyl, vancomycin (___).  The \ncefepime and ciprofloxacin for double coverage of the \nPseudomona, Flagyl for the loose stools, and vancomycin for the \nGram positive coverage.  Oral vancomycin was discontinued as \nrecommended by ID.  He received more than 6 L of fluid in in ED, \nhome antihypertensives were held, and was subsequently getting \ndiuresed in the FICU as his hemodynamics improved.  \n- Will need to narrow antibiotics coverage as cultures return\n\n# LLL consolidation on CXR and speculated mass on CT: Pt had \nlymph node biopsy proven non-necrotizing granulomas; however, \nLLL mass was not adequately biopsied.  Pt was tried on steroids \nfor ___ days and lymphadenopathy and LLL mass were noted to \nhave decreased in size and so it was assumed that they are both \nfrom the same underlying etiology.  However, on re-evaluation at \nthis admission the appearance of the speculated mass is not \nconsistent with sarcoidosis.  Would consider re-evaluation at a \nlater date and possible biopsy for further evaluation as the \npatient has a long history of smoking as well as asbestos \nexposure.  This was possibibility was discussed with patient and \nhis family.  \n\n# Acute Kidney Insufficiency.  Likely pre-renal in the setting \nof sepsis.  He had adequate urine output with the foley catheter \nin place.  There was no evidence of hydronephrosis on the CT, \nmaking obstructive process less likely.  ATN is also possible \ngiven episodes of hypotension.  He was also autodiuresing post \nthe multiple liters of fluid resuscitation in the ED.  \nElectrolytes were checked twice a day given autodiuresis.  \n\n# Hyponatremia. Likely secondary to dehydration.  As he got \nrehydrated, his sodium improved.  He did not present any \nsymptoms of hypernatremia.  \n\n# Urinary retention.  It was noted that patient failed a voiding \ntrial in the outpatient setting.  He had a Foley in place while \nin the FICU and also was started on Flomax as well as \nantibiotics for the UTI/urosepsis  The original plan was to have \nthe foley catheter removed on ___.  \n\n# Anion Gap Acidosis, likely from lactic acidosis.  Resolved.  \nHe also likely has a superimposed non-gap acidosis given \ndelta-delta ration was less than ___ extra-renal losses from \ndirrhea and loose stools.  \n\n# Rectal adenocarcinoma.  S/p laparoscopic low anterior \nresection w/ coloanal anastamosis and ileostomy on ___.  \nPatient was followed by surgery while in the FICU.  \n\n# Sarcoid, diagnosed in ___.  He completed a course of \nprednisone for ___ days with improved imaging.  Repeat CT does \nshow slightly increased opacification in the LLL, which was not \nbiopsied.  He was asymptomatic and maintained adequate O2Sat \nwhile in the FICU.  This finding was discussed with patient in \ndetails (see above for LLL consolidation and spiculated mass on \nCT).  This will need to be followed by his primary care \nprovider.  \n  \n# HTN.  His antihypertensives were held while in the FICU given \nhypotensive episodes. \n\n# HLD.  He continued with rosuvastatin.\n\n# Diabetes mellitus.  Patient's oral medication was held and he \nwas switched to insulin sliding scale\n\nFEN:  IVFs, Diabetic diet, Replete Lytes\nAccess:  3pivs\nPPx:  Tylenol, hold stool softners\nComm: Patient\nEmergency Contact:  Wife - ___ (HCP), cell ___, \nhome ___\nCode:  Full (confirmed)\nDISPO: floor\n\nPt transferred to floor in stable condition and was continued on \nIV antibiotics. He was tolerating a regular diet and having \nbowel movements. He remained afebrile but had a persistently \nelevated WBC count althought his was trending downwards. \nSubsequent urine cultures were negative for any growth. He \ndenied any abdominal pain but began conplaining of right sided \nscrotal pain. His right testicle and scrotum was noted to be \nswollen and tender and an ultrasound was performed which was \nconsistent with orchitis/epidydimytis.

His CXR showed a new RLL infiltrate and he complains of \ncough, making pneumonia most likely diagnosis.  His U/A was \nclear, surgical site is clean and he does not have any focal \nneuro deficits.  Pt was recently intubated for his procedure, \nand as per ___ notes, it seems that he was over sedated at \none point requiring narcan, so the possibility of aspiration is \nquite high.  Given that he was only intubated for procedure we \ntreated his pneumonia as a hospital acquired pneumonia, rather \nthan ventilator acquired pneumonia.  He was initially covered \nwith vancomycin and levaquin, and on HD2 he was narrowed to po \nlevaquin.  Pt remained afebrile without o2 requirement and his \nleukocytosis resolved.  He was discharged with a 7 day \nantibiotic course for hospital acquired pneumonia.  \n\n#Septic Shock:  secondary to pneumonia as above.  On \npresentation, pt was febrile to ___, with leukocytosis and \nhypotensive to ___ systolic.  He had evidence of end organ \nischemia with lactate of 2.1 and acute kidney injury with \nelevated BUN and cr.  He was treated with early goal directed \ntherapy and initially volume resuscitated with a total of 7 \nliters of crystalloid.  Initially his blood pressures did not \nrespond adequately, so he was started on phenylephrine and after \na central line was placed, he was started on norepinephrine.  By \nthe time he reached the ___ MICU, his blood pressure was \nnormotensive and vasopressors were discontinued.  His CVP \nremained \u003e10 so aggressive volume resuscitation was stopped.  \nHis lactate came down to 0.9 and his acute kidney injury \nresolved.  Pt remained normotensive for remainder of FICU \ncourse.  \n\n# s/p Laminectomy - currently no neurological deficits, \nradiculopathy is actually improved since surgery.  Incision site \nwas cdi and his dressing was changed as needed.  At time of \ndischarge, pt still had staples in place and will need to follow \nup with his neuro-surgeon for post-op check and staple removal.  \nHe was continued on post-surgical ppx antibiotics \n(dicloxicillin) as prescribed by his surgeon.   \n\nHTN: Pt's antihypertensive medications were held during \nhospitalization due to shock.  At time of discharge, he was \nnormotensive.  He was instructed to restart his \namlodipine/benazapril, but not to restart his triemtarine/HCTZ \ngiven that he was normotensive at time of discharge.  \n\nSVT: bystolic was held as pt initially in shock.  It was \nrestarted at time of discharge.  \n\nDepression/anxiety: continued with venlafaxine and diazepam.  \n\nTransitional: \n- f/u final blood cultures \n- continue for total 7 day course of levaquin \n- f/u with neurosurgeon for staple removal and post op check \n- will need follow up with PCP within one week of discharge \n \nMedications on Admission:\nNebivolol Hcl (Bystolic) 50 MG PO DAILY\nVenlafaxine 150 MG PO DAILY\nTriamterene \u0026  Hydrochlorothiaz 1 TAB PO DAILY 25 MG/37.5 MG CAP\nClonazepam (Klonopin) 2 MG PO BID PRN\nDiazepam 5MG* (Valium 5MG*)10 MG PO 5XDAY PRN\nHydrocodone-Acetaminophen 1 TAB PO Q4H PRN 10 MG/650 MG\ndicloxicillin \namlodipine/benazapril ___ qday\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. senna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO BID (2 times a \nday) as needed for Constipation: take for constipation while on \nnarcotic medications .\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n2. docusate sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO twice \na day: take while on narcotic medications .\nDisp:*60 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*\n3. methocarbamol 500 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4HR () as \nneeded for muscle spasm.  \n4. diazepam 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q6H (every 6 \nhours) as needed for anxiety.  \n5. venlafaxine 75 mg Capsule, Ext Release 24 hr Sig: Two (2) \nCapsule, Ext Release 24 hr PO DAILY (Daily).  \n6. clonazepam 2 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO twice a day.  \n7.

She states that she is currently menstruating and \nusually more symptomatic around this time, but her symptoms have \nbeen going on for about 3 weeks (scratchy throat, dysphagia) \nwith acute worsening today manifested by hoarse voice, \nodynophagia and intense pain in her lower jaw and teeth.  She \nhas never been intubated in the past.  She has had these \nsymptoms since age ___, but \"just dealt\" with the symptoms up \nuntil she was ___ when she finally decided to be seen by a \ndoctor.  On her intermittent trips to EDs, she was given \nsteroids and she improved slowly, but always wondered if the \nsteroids were actually working.  She was most recently seen by a \nphysician at ___ who made the initial diagnosis with serial C1 \nesterase inhibitor levels (normal) and her constellation of \nsymptoms and started her on Cinryze in ___.  When her \ninsurance no longer covered this doctor, she transferred her \ncare over to ___ Allergy and Immunology, seen yesterday by a \ncovering doctor, with no note in OMR at the time of this \nadmission note.  Of note, she denies any abdominal symptoms or \nnew skin findings.    \n\nIn the ED, initial VS were: 97.2 72 134/82 16 99% RA  Patient \nwas given moprhine 4mg IV for neck pain, but did not complain of \nany trouble breathing or difficulty swallowing saliva.

No \nspontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the \nleft atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is \nseen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic \nfunction is depressed. The right ventricular cavity is dilated \nwith global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal diastolic \nseptal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume \noverload. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta, \naortic arch, and descending thoracic aorta. A mechanical aortic \nvalve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis \nleaflets appear to move normally. Trace aortic regurgitation is \nseen. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. \nThere is posterior mitral valve leaflet restriction with \nmoderate (2+) mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is \nseen on the mitral valve. There is no pericardial effusion.\nIMPRESSION: Posterior mitral leaflet restriction with moderate \nMR. ___ and hypokinetic RV with evidence of RV volume \noverload. Depressed LF systolic function. Well-seated mechanical \naortic valve. Poor RV and tricuspid valve visualization.\n  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe findings are similar. RV and tricuspid valve are better seen \non the previous transthoracic echocardiogram. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ woman with a past medical history of Hodgkin's \nLymphoma ___ years ago, S/P radiation treatment and chemotherapy, \nnow with tetra-valvular disease and known CAD S/P CABG + \nmechanical aortic valve replacement and mitral and tricuspid \nvalve repair on warfarin admitted for evaluation of worsening \nright sided heart failure with right heart catheterization and \nfor heparin drip bridging while holding Coumadin.\n\n# CAD: Known 2 vessel disease from ___ angiography, S/P CABG x \n1 (saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery) in ___. We \ndecreased patient's dose of Metoprolol tartrate 100mg BID \n(discharged on 100 mg metoprolol succinate) to allow for more \nblood pressure room for diuresis. We also continued simvastatin \n40 mg Tablet daily and aspirin 81 mg Tablet daily.\n\n# Pump: Severe biventricular systolic heart failure with LVEF = \n35-40%, evidence of elevated right heart pressures from \noutpatient transthroacic echocardiogram. Right heart \ncatheterization demonstrated large PCW V waves consistent with \nsignifican mitral regurgitation, along with mean PCW 25 mm Hg, \nconsistent with acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic \nheart failure. Follow up TEE showed only 2+ moderate mitral \nregurgitation. Medical management for now as benefit of mitral \nvalve surgery uncertain. We changed her enalapril 10 mg daily to \nlisinopril 5 mg daily to achieve more blood pressure room to \nallow for torsemide 50 mg daily (patient was on 40 mg tablet \ndaily initially but a week prior to coming into the hospital she \nwas on 50 mg). While in house, patient regularly had blood \npressures in the 80-90s systolic range, which was asymptomatic, \nhowever, in an effort to diurese the patient and reduce her \nPCWP, we made the blood pressure medication changes as above.\n\n# Rhythm: LBBB on EKG. Disynchronous beating by echo, but likely \nto right sided increased pressures and failure. Otherwise not \nactive issue.\n\n# Valvular heart disease, S/P mechanical AVR: On warfarin at \nhome. We restarted warfarin ___, 5 mg daily, with INR 2.5 at \ndischarge. Goal INR of 2.5-3.5, when patient was subtherapeutic, \nshe was on a heparin drip.\n\n# Cough: upper respiratory tract infection versus dry room. Less \nlikely is strep throat as patient is afebrile. Patient with some \ncoughing and pink tinged sputum which is likely exacerbated by \nwarfarin and heparin. She is not having pain with swallowing and \nhad a runny nose while in house. No chest pain or cough from \nlungs. Afebrile. Patient was given Cepacol, Tylenol and Tessalon \nPerles PRN.\n\n# Lymphoma from age ___. s/p radiation. Otherwise not active.\n\n# History of depression: Controlled with citalopram 20 mg daily.\n\n# Iron deficinecy: patient not anemic now, MCV 95, we continued \nher outpatient iron preparation.\n\n# Transitional\n-We decreased patient's blood pressure medications to allow more \nroom for diuresis.  As mentioned, patient was asymptomatic, but \nwill continue to benefit from diuresis in light of her PCWP of \napproximately 28.

Mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation. \nModerate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.\n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe severity of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation has \nincreased. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher \n(previously 43 mmHg). \n\n___ RIGHT HEART CATH (Final report pending)\nRA 9, PA mean 30, PCWP ___ is a ___ year old woman with a PMH significant for HTN and \nDM-II, who recently had a protracted hospital course, \ncharacterized by respiratory, renal and hepatic failure. She was \ndischarged to rehab and eventually returned home, as her system \nfailure resolved. She returns now with dyspnea, elevated BNP and \nsevere pulmonary edema, concerning for acute heart failure, in \nthe setting of mild chronic diastolic heart failure and \nhypertension.  \n\nActive Issues:\n\n# CHF with preserved ejection fraction:  Over the 4 days prior \nto admission she developed dyspnea and 3 pillow orthopnea. Upon \nadmission she was found to have elevated blood pressures (MAPs \nas high as 105), BNP over 5000, and severe pulmonary edema on CT \nchest (done to rule out PE) concerning for acute heart failure. \nTTE showed EF 55% and moderate mitral regurgitation, mild to \nmoderate tricuspid regurgitation, moderate pulmonary artery \nsystolic hypertension with elevated TR gradient of 55. She \ndiuresed well to 80 IV Lasix daily and was weaned to RA on HD. \nOn HD2 she underwent a right heart cath which showed elevated \nfilling pressures (PCWP 22) so she continued on IV diuresis. Her \nheart failure exacerbation was most likely due to high blood \npressure. She had a mild troponin elevation (0.02) which was \nstable on repeat checks, denied chest pain, and had no ischemic \nEKG changes. Upon discharge she was ambulating without dyspnea \nand satting well on RA.   \n\n# Hypertensive emergency: BP elevated to 178/125 on admission. \nShe was started on losartan 25 mg daily. Home metoprolol was \ndiscontinued.\n\nChronic Issues:\n\n#h/o Diabetes mellitus. Off medications.  Hgb A1C 5.2.  \n\n# Asthma. Advair, albuterol nebs PRN.  \n\n# GERD.

Continue ropinirole, duloxetine\n\n# Recent renal failure: Cr was 1.3-1.5 on this admission, much \nimproved from prior hospitalization at which time she had \nreqiured HD. Her home sevelamer was continued; bicarb was \nstopped.\n\n\u003e\u003e TRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n# She will follow up with hepatology as an outpatient for \nhistory of liver failure of still unclear etiology, possibly due \nto antibiotics and supplements she was taking for chronic lyme. \n# Diuretic regimen on discharge: 20mg torsemide daily. Please \ncheck electrolytes at next appointment.\n# She was discharged on 25 mg of losartan daily. Metoprolol was \ndiscontinued. Please f/u BPs on this regimen and check lytes at \nnext appointment.\n-Labs pending at discharge: cerulosplasmin\n-Her sodium bicarb was discontinued as she was no longer in \nrenal failure. Continued her calcium carbonate given elevated \nphos.\n-AM cortisol was 6.4 during this admission. This is \nborderline-low for a morning cortisol. She is planning to see an \nendocrinologist close to home for her hypothyroidism; additional \nwork up for adrenal insufficiency could be considered at that \ntime. \n\n-discharge weight: 68.2 kg\n-discharge Creatinine: 1.5\n\n# Contact: husband, ___ \n# Code Status: FULL CODE \n\n \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Recommend clinical correlation. \n. \nEchocardiogram\nThe left atrium is moderately dilated. The right atrium is \nmoderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular \nhypertrophy with normal cavity size and regional/global systolic \nfunction (LVEF\u003e55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free \nwall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, \nascending and arch levels are normal. The aortic valve leaflets \n(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. \nMild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve \nleaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is \nseen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is \nnormal. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: No PFO or ASD. Symmetric LVH with normal global and \nregional biventricular systolic function. Mild aortic \nregurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation. Atrial fibrillation.\n.\nRepeat MRI ___\nThe previously noted right paramedian pontine acute infarct, \nappears more \nconspicuous, visible on T2 and FLAIR weighted sequences, there \nis no evidence \nof hemorrhagic transformation.  There is no evidence of new \ndiffusion \nabnormalities to indicate new acute or subacute ischemic \nchanges. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ yo male, PMH of Afib on apixaban, HTN, HLD, presents from \nhome with exam concerning for dysarthria, INO on leftward gaze, \nataxia, and mild left sided weakness found to have acute right \ngreater than left pontine stroke on MRI. Given the location of \nhis stroke we believe that his stroke was most likely from small \nvessel disease. However, the lack of atherosclerosis on his CTA \nand because of his history of atrial fibrillation, he is at \nincreased risk for embolic disease that could have transiently \noccluded bilateral pontine perforators then cleared. CTA showed \nanterior and posterior circulation that showed patent \nvasculature and low atherosclerotic burden. His stroke symptoms \nfluctuated greatly during his admission. His dysarthria was \nintermittent, leftward INO was intermittent but became very \nprominent on discharge, and his left sided weakness increased \nand was especially marked in his leg. At the time of discharge \nhe had Left sided ___ IP strength, ___ hamstring strength and \n___ tibialis anterior. He also developed left ptosis, \nintermittent exotropia of his left eye, and was unable to ABduct \nhis right eye. He underwent repeat MRI because of these new \nfindings on ___ which showed no new stroke but that his old \nstroke was more conspicuous on DWI comparfed to prior MRI on \n___. \n\nHe underwent echocardiogram that showed moderate left and right \natrial enlargement, no ASD or PFO, and no intracardiac thrombus. \nEF was \u003e55% and there was mild aortic and mitral regurgitation. \nTelemetry showed that the patient was constantly in atrial \nfibrillation and occasionally bradycardic while on a lower dose \nof his home sotalol. Because of the nighttime bradycardia down \nto the ___ at times with 3 second pauses on telemetry, he was \ndischarged on this lower dose of sotalol. Higher blood pressures \nwere also tolerated while as an inpatient and his quinipril was \nheld on discharge. Depending on BP at the rehab, he could resume \nhis home dose of quinipril with goal normotension.  \n\nRegarding his risk factors: \nLDL was 101 and HbA1C was 5.7. He was started on Atorvastatin \n40mg daily which he should continue after discharge.\n\nHe was continued on his home dose of apixaban which he should \ncontinue to take as he was prior to hospitalization. We \ncautioned the patient regarding stopping his apixaban in the \nfuture given this stroke. \n\nPhysical therapy and occupational therapy worked with the \npatient and given his degree of unbalance, he required discharge \nto rehab facility. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n- Sotalol is at half dose of admission medication - Heart rates \nwithin normal limits.\n- Quinipril was not given during admission, this can be \nrestarted after getting to rehab with goal of normotension\n- Has follow up appointment with Dr. ___ - neurology in \naround ___ months. \n\nAHA/ASA Core Measures for Ischemic Stroke and Transient Ischemic \nAttack  \n1.

Pt called her \ncardiologist who recommended that she go directly to the ED. \nPrior to arrival in the ED, pt denied any HA, blurry vision, \nchest pain, palpitations, weakness, numbness. Pt does report \nsome intermittent bilateral hand swelling and a feeling as \nthough her pulses were \"jumping\". She did have an episode of \ndyspnea on exertion on ambulation into the ED. After receiving \nnitro in the ED, pt developped a headache.  \n.  \nOn arrival to the ED VS: T-98.8 BP 205/103 HR 66 RR 18 Sat 98%. \nPt received ASA 325mg, nitropaste, clonidine 0.1mg, tylenol \n1gram, Oxycodone 15mg, Dilaudid 2mg po. On arrival to the floor, \npt was feeling well, denying any HA, blurry vision, chest pain \nor SOB.  \n.  \nOn review of systems, she denies any prior history of stroke, \nTIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cough, SOB, \nblack stools, red stools, dysuria, constipation, diarrhea. She \ndenies recent fevers, chills or rigors. Pt does report \nsignificant low back pain with minimal ambulation due to spinal \nstenosis. She also reports poor wound healing, but no systems of \nclaudication.  \n.  \nCardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain, \ndyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, \nankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  \n\n \nPast Medical History:\nPeripheral Vascular Disease  \nHyperlipidemia  \nType II DM  \nHypertension  \nChronic Kidney Disease  \nCAD s/p silent MI in ___ \u0026 ___  \ns/p PPM in ___ after MI (placed for unclear indications)  \n\n \nSocial History:\n___\nFamily History:\nSister who passed away from DMII, CRF\n \nPhysical Exam:\nVS: T- 98.7 BP 144/71 HR 59 RR 18 Sats 95% RA  \nGen: NAD.

High resolution CT \nis recommended for further characterization as well as \ncorrelative PFT's if warranted clinically. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n# Hypertensive Urgency/Emergency: Pt presented with \nsignificantly elevated BPs in 220/120 range after completing a \nclonidine wean.  Pt was essentially asymptomatic on presentation \nbut developped a headache in the ED after receiving a nitrate \nand had a head CT that did not show any evidence of ICH.  BP was \nbetter controlled on arrival to floor but was very labile on day \n2 of admission. She had an episode of vomiting on day 2 most \nlikely related to lisinopril intolerance (prior reaction with \nN/V).  Pt was noted to have a significant CK elevation with \nnormal MB fraction that trended down in house, it is unclear if \nthis elevation was due to demand ischemia vs myopathy. The \netiology of the hypertensive urgency was thought most likely due \nto recently cessation of clonidine although pt also reported \ntaking OTC diet pills \u0026 dietary indiscretions.  In keeping with \nher ___ plan, pt was kept off clonidine.  Pt reported many \nmedication intolerances including CCBs, but she was switched \nfrom Toprol to Labetalol 400mg BID and was started on HCTZ 25mg \nwhich she tolerated well. Otherwise, she was continued on Lasix \n40mg \u0026 Benzapril 20mg.  BP was decently well controlled and \nattending felt that the patient was stable for disharge on this \nregimen with plan for follow up with PCP and cardiologist.\n.  \n#. CAD: Pt has a h/o CAD but we were unable to obtain additional \nrecords from ___, PCP denied having any recent records. Pt \ndenied any chest pain throughout admission but reported some DOE \non way into ED. EKG from ED had some non-specific changes \nthought most likely due to LVH and hypertensive urgency. Pt was \nnoted to have a significantly increased CK at 1361, MB fraction \nwas normal. Troponin was mildly elevated at 0.04 most likely due \nto CRI.  CK's trended down to 830 in house and pt was continued \non ASA 325mg, Labetalol, Benzapril and Lovastatin.  PCP was \nnotified about CK elevation and pt will need a follow up CK at \nher next follow up and may need to stop statin if the CK remains \nelevated.\n.  \n#. Pump/Abn CXR: Pt had a recent echo showing preserved LVEF at \n65% with impaired relaxation, mild AS, mild MR, and mild to \nmoderate TR. Pt was noted to have some scattered crackles on \nexam but was sating well on RA \u0026 denied any symptoms of volume \noverload. Official CXR reading described findings more \nconsistent with an interstitial process than with pulmonary \nedema and recommended a follow up CT.  Pt did not have any \ninfectious symptoms and was scheduled to see Pulmonary in follow \nup as an outpatient.  She was continued on Lasix 40mg daily.  \n.  \n#. Diabetes: Pt described good BS control at home but last \nHgbA1c\u003e10.   Pt was discharged on her home regimen of Insulin \nwith glipizide and was encouraged to discuss blood sugar control \nwith her PCP in follow up.\n.  \n# Elevated CK: CK was notably elevated at 1300 on admission, MB \nfraction remained essentially normal and CK trended down to 830 \nspontaneously.  Pt did complain of some intermittent lower \nextremity myopathies and has a lower extremity angiogram \nscheduled for next week.  Extremities remained warm and pulses \nwere palpable, the lower extremity pain seemed to resolve \nspontaneously.  Etiology of the CK elevation was unclear, it is \npossible that the CK elevation was related to demand ischemia or \nit may have been due to the statin.  Statin induced myositis was \nthought less likely given that it trended down spontaneously \nwhile continuing the medication.  PCP was notified about this \nelevation and pt will need follow up labs to trend CK. \n\n# Chronic Pain meds: Pt's pain was well controlled in house on \nher chronic pain regimen of Oxycodone 15mg q8hr prn and pt was \ndischarged on this regimen that was clearly outlined by her PCP \nin their ___ contract.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nHumulin 70/30 40units qam \u0026 15units qhs  \nCymbalta 40mg  \nAspirin 81mg  \nAlbuterol  \nLasix 40mg  \nLovastatin 60mg  \nMetoprolol 100mg BID  \nGlipizide 5mg BID  \nOxycodone 15mg TID prn  \nBenzapril 20mg daily  \n(clonidine recently stopped)  \n-recently started taking Hoodia  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Her \nCXR is interesting for a stable left pleural effusion with only \nmild pulmonary vascular congestion. She was diuresed and \ndischarged to rehab. \n\nACTIVE ISSUES: \n#  CHF exacerbation: the patient presented with SOB and hypoxia \nmost likely due to a CHF exacerbation. The trigger for her \nexacerbation was unclear, but she has been admitted from rehab \nfacility for CHF exacerbations multiple times in the past year. \nIt was possible that d/t agitation and restlessness she had \nhypertensive episodes that caused flash pulmonary edema. Her \ncondition was certainly exacerbated by underlying reactive \nairway disease. She received 80 IV lasix in the ED and continued \nto receive IV lasix on a BID basis for fluid overload. Her urine \noutput was monitored with a Foley. She required periodic 2 L NC \nfor hypoxia, although she was not requiring O2 by day of \ndischarge. During this time, her home torsemide was initially \nstopped. It was recontinued on the day prior to discharge at an \nunchanged dose of 80 mg daily. Her other CHF \nmedications--amlodipine, metoprolol tartrate, and \nvalsartan--were continued. \n\n# tremor: patient was noted to have tremor/shaking on exam in \nthe ED. She had no other focal neurological deficits, although \nthis was difficult to interpret in light of her agitated mental \nstate. Her daughter reports has happened in the past when she \ngets diuretics (confirmed by discharge summaries). This could be \ndue to electrolyte loss but the association between tremor and \nlasix is unclear at the moment. As she continued to receive \ndiuretics, she did not develop worsening of the tremor, and it \nin fact improved such that it was gone by hospital day #2 and \ndid not recur. \n\n# UTI: She had a negative UA on admission, although she has h/o \nsevere UTI in the past. After day #3 with the Foley in place, \nturbid and foul-smelling urine was noted, prompting a repeat UA \nthat showed 12 WBCs and bacteria. She was started on empiric \n5-day course of PO Cipro for UTI, with ucx pending at time of \ndischarge. \n\n#  atrial fibrillation: the patient's home dose of warfarin was \ndecreased to 3 on hospital day #1, and continued at this dose \ngiven supratherapeutic INR, although she missed a dose on ___ \ndue to pharmacy withholding the dose for an INR of 4.7. She was \ndischarged with a changed dose of 2 mg warfarin daily. She was \ncontinued on her home dose of metoprolol.  \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES: \n\n# dementia: patient has h/o dementia and agitated delirium which \nis usual for her in the setting of hospitalizations where she is \nexposed to new people and environments. During her stay, she was \nmore agitated for the first couple of days, and at one point was \nthrowing things at her nurses. ___ was intermittently agitated, \nand completely dis-oriented to place, time, and location which \nis her known norm. She did not require olanzapine (which in the \npast has not been successful). She was continued on her home \n12.5 mg quetiapine and 25 mg tramadol qhs. Beginning on ___, \nshe refused IV access and pulled out her IVs so could not be \ngiven IV meds. She had to be persuaded by ___ staff \nto allow the phlebotomist to draw her blood. She had to be \ncoaxed to take her PO medications with chocolate ice cream, \nwhich she enjoys. \n\n#  CAD: two-vessel disease as seen on cath in ___. She was \ncontinued on her home 81 mg ASA, metoprolol, atorvastatin 10 mg \n  \n#  HTN: she was continued on home metoprolol 50 mg TID, imdur 90 \nmg \n \n#  Reactive airway disease: she was given duonebs as needed for \nSOB \n\n#  CKD: patient's admitting Cr was 1.7, giving her an eGFR of \n24.6. Her outpt nephrologist feels this is most likely a \ncombination of microvascular disease from diabetes and \nhypertension with an overlay of cardiorenal syndrome. Her Cr \nremained stable around 1.5 for most of her stay and increased to \n1.8 on day of discharge, felt to ___ ___ UTI. \n\n***Transitional issues:***\n\n- anticoagulation: Please check INR on ___. Pt is on reduced \ndose of warfarin (2 mg). ___ need to adjust coumadin while on \nabx. \n- torsemide dose: pt will be continued on 80 torsemide daily. \nDiscuss any changes to her HF regimen with heart failure clinic. \n\n- pending labs: please follow up on urine and blood cultures \nfrom this stay.

She received empiric vanc/zosyn, \nas well as IV flagyl for coverage of c diff empirically. The ACS \nservice was consulted for consideration of ischemic colitis as \npotential source of rising lactate and persistent hypotension. \nHer exam was concerning for abdominal distension and apparent \ndiscomfort with abdominal palpation, and CT was suggestive of \npossible ischemic colitis related to massive dilaion of bowel \nwith stool. They thought her sepsis was likely due to a urinary \nsource rather than ischemic bowel, and did not think surgical \nintervention was indicated.

Likely cause of cardiac arrest was thought to be \nhypoxemia as patient was found to be satting in the ___ on \nrehab. It was determined that there was no need to undergo \ncooling protocol as patient's mental status was at baseline. \nShock was determined to be septic secondary to ongoing infection \nat her cervical spine, as incision site was noted to be draining \npurulent fluid. She was started broadly on vanc/cefepime/flagyl. \n\n\nPatient was noted to have distended abdomen on exam. Given \nhistory of hep B cirrhosis she underwent diagnostic paracentesis \ndue to concern for SBP in the setting of septic shock. \nPeritoneal fluid grew yeast and she was started on micafungin \nfor fungal peritonitis.\n\nPatient also presented with acute on chronic hypoxemic \nrespiratory failure requiring CMV. CXR showed a large left \npleural effusion. It was thought that she may have had a \nseizure, causing aspiration and thus hypoxemia. ___ was \nobtained given mild c/f PE and ruled out DVT. She was also \ncontinued on home phenytoin, keppra and lacosamide.  \n\nOn hospital day 3 at 1550 patient was becoming increasingly \nbradycardic. She received atropine 0.5mg x1 without effect. At \n1600 she was noted to be apneic. Family was notified and \nrequested that patient be kept alive until her husband arrived \non ___ night. However it was determined that CPR was not \nindicated as discussed on rounds in the morning. At 1605 she \nwent into asystole.

The patient had an uncomplicated \npost-operative course and was discharged on POD#3.\n\nUpon evaluation, there was concern for a small bowel \nobstruction. CT imaging revealed signs of a potential \nmid-jejunal obstruction. He had an NG tube placed and was \nadmitted for IVF and monitoring.\n\nOn ___, it was noted that his pain was increasing and not \nadequately controlled by the IV dilaudid. His NGT was advanced \nto the appropriate depth and he had up to 750 cc suctioned over \nthe day with some relief of his discomfort.\n\nOn hospital day 5, a PICC line was placed by the IV team and \nnutrition consulted regarding TPN. He was started on TPN on \n___ and IVF was reduced to maintenance level. \n\nOn hospital 6 and ___, he passed flatus and was having bowel \nmovements. His JP drain was removed due to consistently low \noutput as was the NG tube. His diet was advanced to sips. Early \nmorning of hospital day 8, he vomited and NG tube was replaced \nwith about 100 cc of output. He developed tachycardia to the \n120s, a fever of 101.4, and WBC count from 12 to 20.6. He was \nevaluated and it was determined that he should undergo a CT \nAbdomen/Pelvis with both IV and PO contrast to look for fluid \ncollections, abscesses around the surgical site, or a \nre-obstruction of the intestines. The study revealed a high \ngrade SBO with abnormal mucosal hyperenhancement of the \nneoterminal ileum and cecum, suggestive of active Crohn's \ndisease; however, this finding was similar to a past study done \nin ___. Gastroenterology was consulted and recommended treating \nthe SBO and an outpatient colonoscopy, for which he is due. For \nthe time, no specialized treatment or further diagnostic testing \nwould be useful over a colonoscopy when able. \n\nHe was taken to the OR on hospital day 10 for exploratory \nlaparotomy with lysis of adhesions. Post-operatively, he had his \npain managed acutely via an epidural by the Acute Pain Service. \nIt was removed on POD5 (hospital day 15) as well as the foley. \nHe was transitioned to IV pain medication and had return of \nbowel function.\n\nHis diet was advanced as tolerated to a regular diet with \ncontinuous bowel function and pain controlled. His was \ndischarged home on HOD ___ in stable condition. \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1. lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide ___ mg oral Daily \n2.

Moving forward, achieving and maintaining \ngood control of your blood pressure is of utmost importance. We \nare increasing your blood pressure medications to help control \nyour blood pressure moving forward. Your PCP can follow up on \nyour blood pressure and may make further adjustments in the \nfuture.\n\nAlthough you were on Coumadin to prevent blood clots that could \ncause stroke due to your atrial fibrillation, we feel the risk \nof bleeding again in the future outweighs the risk of having \nblood clots.\n\n We are changing your medications as follows: \n\n STOP taking Warfarin. \n INCREASE your dose of Losartan from 25mg daily to 100mg daily.\n START HCTZ\n INCREASE metoprolol dosage\n\n Please take your other medications as prescribed.  \n\n Please follow up with Neurology and your primary care physician \n\nas listed below.  \n\n If you experience any of the symptoms below, please seek \nemergency medical attention by calling Emergency Medical \nServices (dialing 911). In particular, since stroke can recur, \nplease pay attention to the sudden onset and persistence of \nthese symptoms:  \n\n - Sudden partial or complete loss of vision  \n - Sudden loss of the ability to speak words from your mouth  \n - Sudden loss of the ability to understand others speaking to \nyou  \n - Sudden weakness of one side of the body  \n - Sudden drooping of one side of the face  \n - Sudden loss of sensation of one side of the body  \n\n Sincerely,  \n\n Your ___ Neurology Team\n\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"}

No focal liver \nlesion is identified. No biliary dilatation is seen and the \ncommon duct measures 0.3 cm. The gallbladder is normal in \nappearance with no gallstones. The pancreas and aorta are \nobscured from view by overlying bowel gas. The spleen is again \nnoted to be enlarged measuring 13.8 cm, unchanged from the prior \nultrasound. No hydronephrosis is seen on limited views of the  \nkidneys. No ascites is seen in the abdomen.\nDOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color Doppler and spectral waveform \nanalysis was performed. The main, right and left portal veins \nare patent with hepatopetal flow. Appropriate arterial waveforms \nare seen in the main hepatic artery. The hepatic veins are \npatent and the splenic vein is patent at the splenic hilum.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No biliary obstruction and no focal liver lesion identified.\n2. Patent hepatic vasculature.\n3. Stable splenomegaly.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ man with H/O methamphetamine induced dilated \ncardiomyopathy (LVEF 35% in ___ hepatitis C, HIV (history of \nnon-compliance with HAART), polysubstance abuse, DVT on Coumadin \n(___) which was discontinued due to noncompliance in ___ who presents as planned direct admission arranged by \ncardiology clinic with orthostasis, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, \nand acute renal failure (baseline cr=0.9).\n\nAcute Renal Failure:\nPatient had recent lab values consistent with acute renal \nfailure. His blood urea nitrogen was 70 and creatinine was 2.3, \nsuggestive of a prerenal etiology for his acute renal failure. \nFurther supporting this diagnosis was the fact that the patient \nhad recently been taking torsemide and having his dose decreased \nsecondary to polyuria over the past month. Upon arrival to the \nfloor, the patient had not taken any of his medications \nprescribed for heart failure with the exception of metoprolol. \nIn the absence of torsemide, the patient's serum transaminases \nand serum creatinine slightly decreased. The patient was given a \n500 mL bolus of normal saline and he ate a regular meal for \ndinner without fluid restrictions. By withholding the loop \ndiuretic and repleting intravascular volume, his sodium, \npotassium, and creatinine normalized the following day. As a \nresult, all of the patient's medications with the exception of \nmetoprolol were held. Given that the patient has systolic heart \nfailure, he will need restarted on these medications. It is \nlikely that his medication regimen was escalated slightly too \naggressively and needs to retitrated.  \n- The patient has follow-up labs which will be drawn in 2 days, \nand he has an appointment with his primary care physician who \ncan review the laboratory values and reassess the patient’s \nmedications.\n- The patient also has an appointment with his out patient \ncardiologist in 6 days. During that visit, Dr. ___  ___ \nre-titrate the patient’s medications for optimal cardiac \nsecondary and primary prevention.\n\nElevated AST/ALT:  \n- Patient presented with market elevations in his serum \ntransaminases. Our differential for this diagnosis was broad. \nGiven his past history of DVT, there was a concern of hepatic \nvenous thrombosis. This was excluded by his right upper quadrant \nDoppler ultrasound study. Congestive hepatopathy is also an \nunlikely diagnosis given that the patient was clinically \neuvolaemic or even hypovolemic upon presentation. A viral \netiology for his liver enzyme abnormalities could not be ruled \nout given the patient's HIV and hepatitis C. Hepatology was \nconsulted and they felt like the most likely cause of his \nelevated liver enzymes was due to hypoperfusion. Once the \npatient was given back volume, his liver enzymes trended down \nslightly (but were still markedly elevated). His primary care \nphysician ___ check his LFTs on ___ and should abnormalities \nstill persist then outpatient referral to a hepatologist may be \nwarranted.\nRecommendations per hepatology consult:\n1. Continue to monitor LFTs until recovery to baseline.\n2. F/u HCV viral load q 6 months \n3. Maintain adequate blood pressure and avoid systemic arterial \nhypotension\n4. OK to do trial of Atripla once his LFTs normalize.\n\nChronic left ventricular systolic heart failure.\nEchocardiogram performed the day prior to admission showed LVEF \n35%-40%. There was mild to moderate global left ventricular \nhypokinesis with normal cavity size. Mildly dilated right \nventricular cavity with mild free wall hypokinesis. Compared \nwith the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the left \nventricular cavity is less dilated, the global function is \nimproved, and the degree of mitral regurgitation is decreased. \nHe was continued on his beta-blocker.\n\nIn summary: the patient presented to ___ 3 generally feeling \nwell. He has been able to walk his dogs several miles a day \nwithout chest pain or shortness of breath. His appetite was good \nand the patient was in good spirits during his hospitalization. \nHis lab abnormalities began to correct in the setting of holding \nhis medications (with the exception of his beta blocker) and \nputting the patient on a regular diet. \n \nMedications on Admission:\n1. Digoxin: 125 µg once a day\n2. Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day\n3. Atripla 1 tab at bedtime (not started, but prescribed 1 day \nago)\n4. Lisinopril 20 mg daily\n5.

Pazopanib had been held in ___ in case of infection, as he was having more nausea than \nbefore and reporting mouth pain. Resumed pazopanib on ___. \nHe did not take pazopanib for 4 days PTA given nausea/vomiting. \nHe is on 10mg Prednisone daily (for chemo/gout) but had not \ntaken his dose for 4 days PTA ___ nausea/vomiting. Pt had CT \ntorso w/o contrast on ___ for routine cancer staging (was \nscheduled as outpatient for ___ but performed in-house for pt \nconvenience), which showed unchanged small scattered mediastinal \nLNs, no new pulmonary nodules, an indeterminate hyperdense \nexophytic lesion arising from the upper pole of the left kidney \nmeasuring 16 x 19 mm (previously 12 x 16 mm), known renal cell \ncarcinoma arising from the interpolar left kidney that is \npartially exophytic and measuring 26 x 30 mm (previously 26 x 32 \nmm), known atrophic right kidney, and stable retroperitoneal \nlymphadenopathy. Pazopanib held during admission and will be \nrestarted at rehab. Prednisone 10mg daily continued. Pt may need \nPET as outpatient for staging given known metastatic disease.\n\n# Retro-orbital Lesion on ___:\nCT head ___ showed 1.3cm retro-orbital lesion that had been \npresent on CT ___ but was much smaller at that time. PERRL, \nEOMI, no pain with eye movements, no double or blurry vision per \npt, possible inferior visual field defect on exam (but Dr. \n___ Neuro ___ did not appreciate any visual field \ndeficits). Suspect that this lesion is most likely a vascular \nstructure. Patient was scheduled to follow-up with ophthalmology \nregarding further evaluation of this lesion.  Further imaging \ncould be considered including open MRI with contrast, although \nhis CKD is borderline for gadolinium contrast. \n\n# Nausea/vomiting: Resolved and pt tolerating PO by HD2 after \nstarting ceftriaxone for suspected UTI. Therefore, \nnausea/vomiting was most likely related to UTI, as pt reports \nnausea/vomiting with prior UTIs. On presentation, pt was not \nendorsing urinary urgency/frequency/dysuria, but UA with large \n___, \u003e182 WBCs, and few bacteria. Urine cx with mixed bacterial \nflora. Cannot rule out that nausea/vomiting is due to viral \ngastroenteritis or side effect of pazopanib (although had not \ntaken for 4 days PTA). Unlikely GI/biliary source of \nnausea/vomiting as LFTs and tbili were WNL.

Low \nCD4 puts her at increased risk for cryptosporidium, MAC, \nisospora, microsporidium, CMV and giardia, however, her diarrhea \nimproved and her fevers resolved. She has had no recent HAART \nmedication changes. Also, given low CD4, inflitrative diseases \nsuch as Kaposi and lymphoma should remain on the ddx, though \nless likely, given acuity. Additionally she has known multiple \ncolonic diverticuli and she may have developed diverticulitis, \nhowever she had no further fevers during this hospitalization \nand her abdominal exam was benign and inconsistent with \ndiverticulitis. Stool studies were negative to date; blood \nculture was also negative to date and we discontinued empiric \ncipro/flagyl per ID recommendations on consultation, given that \nher diarrhea and fevers resolved and clinically she looked so \nwell.  She was discharged with close ID follow-up.\n \n#HIV/AIDS: CD4 of 24 on ___ we continued darunavin stribild, \nas well as azithromycin and atovaquone ppx given CD4 count. \n\n___: mild Cr elevation likely in the setting of poor po intake \na fluid lossess from diarrhea is s/p IVF In ED. Cr initially \nimproved with IVF, however, then plateaued at a value of 1.4 \nwhich was above her baseline of 0.8. Urine lytes yielded a FeNa \nof 2.2%, with granular casts on her urine sediment,  suggestive \nof ATN in the setting of dehydration. She had good urine output \nand was discharged with outpatient labs to be done the week \nfollowing didscharge for a creatinine check.\n  \n# Transaminitis: Improved. This was a new problem for her, ratio \nof elevation is most consistent with alcholic hepatocellular \ndamage, however, she denies etoh. Could also be from infectious \nillness which is being worked up as above. In an immune \nsuppressed patient with diarrhea and elevated transaminases and \nAlkphos, it is improtant to consider MAC, however, given her \nclinical picture, this was thought to be less likely.  \n \n# Anemia: normocytic anemia with normal RDW that appears to be \nat baseline since ___, likely secondary to chronic disease. \nTbili normal and no evidence of schistocytes, so hemolysis from \nan infectious process less likely. This remained stable \nthroughout her admission.\n  \n# Monocytosis: Resolved. not uncommon in the setting of \ninflammatory states and AI conditions and corticosteroid \nexposure. Also known to accompany conditions associated with \nneutropenia, thought to be compensatory. Infectiuons may also be \nassociated with moncytosis. Monocytosis may also be seen in \ncertain malignancies, such as lymphomas.  \n\n****TRANSITIONAL ISSUES****\n- patient discharged with a Creatinine of 1.4 (from high of \n1.8), which is above a recent baseline of 0.8. FeNa and urine \nsediment with granular casts. She was discharged with a script \nto have a creatinine checked shortly after discharge for close \nfollow-up. PCP should receive these results and follow-up. If \nstill elevated, she may benefit from Renal evaluation\n- Question of non-adherence to HAART and prophylactic abx should \nbe addressed, given low CD4 count.

Heparin drip was \ndiscontinued and IVC filter was placed at OSH prior to patient \nbeing transferred to ___ for neurosurgical evaluation. On \nadmission patient was admitted to the ___ for close \nneurological monitoring with the following hospital course \nbelow.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES ADDRESSED\n=======================\n#Concern for epidural hemorrhage\nWhen patient arrived to the ICU she reported her BLE \nstrength/motor was stable to when she left ___ on ___ or \npossibly improved. A second opinion ___ was obtained on the OSH \nMRI L spine which showed the fluid collection was likely \nconsistent with a postsurgical seroma. No hematoma present. She \nwas restarted on heparin gtt for saddle PE and DVTs. \n\n#Saddle PE\nBilateral DVTs\nPatient was admitted to the ICU satting 94-95% on RA. VSS. Based \non second opinion ___ of her MRI L spine at the OSH there was \nno concern for hemorrhage and she was restarted on her heparin \ngtt for Saddle PE and DVTs with goal PTT 50-70. MASCOT was \ncontacted who determined the patient was not a candidate for \ncatheter based thrombolysis given her clinical exam, and stable \nrespiratory picture. IVC filter was not removed. Heparin gtt was \ntitrated for a ptt goal of 60-80, goal was attained on ___. \nPatient was started on Coumadin on ___ with plan for bridge off \nof heparin gtt. INRs were checked daily for a goal INR of ___. \nPatient was transitioned from her heparin gtt to Coumadin on \n___. On ___, her Coumadin was held for a supratherapeutic INR \nof 3.5. During morning rounds, it was noted that her left leg \nwas significantly swollen and the patient was complaining of \npain. An ultrasound was completed which demonstrated that there \nwas no flow of the deep veins in the left leg. Vascular surgery \nwas reconsulted; they wrapped her leg and pulse checks were \ninitiated. A hematology/oncology consult was ordered and labs to \nrule out HIT were sent. Hematology recommended reversing the \nCoumadin since it is possible the patient is non-responsive and \nto start her on therapeutic Lovenox. CTA abdomen, pelvis, and \nlower extremities showed extension of DVT to level of common \nilliacs with partial occlusion to total occlusion of LLE. The \npatient's lovenox was titrated for therapeutic level of 0.86 at \n4 hrs post-administration of lovenox ___ mg SC Q12H. Patient to \nf/u with vascular medicine after discharge. Patient to obtain \ncompression stockings for b/l leg swelling as outpatient to \nincrease compression and blood return to lower extremities.\n\n#Orthostatic hypotension: Likely ___ prolonged immobility over \nthe\nlast few weeks, also poor cardiac reserve in the setting of \nlarge\nclot burden. She has been persistently tachycardic, which is\nexpected for her RV function and clot burden. TTE on ___ showed \nnormal RV function and size. AM cortisol negative for adrenal \ninsufficiency. Her orthostatic hypotension improved and on day \nof d/c was negative for drop in BP and she was asymptomatic when \nstanding and walking with physical therapy team.\n\n#Elevated transaminases: Patient with increased AST, ALT, \nalkaline phosphatase on ___ from stable prior ___. No liver \nhistory. Transaminases were mildly elevated on arrival with peak \nof 5x ULN (AST 158, ALT 300) suggesting exacerbation of a \npre-existing liver condition. Physical exam and CT with contrast \nare unremarkable for any evidence of chronic liver disease (and \ndo not suggest Budd-Chiari). TTE did not show evidence of R \nheart failure from the PE, so it is not congestive hepatopathy. \nHepatitis labs and autoimmune lab w/u was thus far negative. \nLFTs were downtrending on d/c. We would recommend outpatient w/u \nof issue as transitional issue.\n\n# Urinary retention: Patient has had persistent urinary \nretention since her operation, has been persistent and stable \nfor over 2 weeks. She received intermittent straight cath Q6hr.\n\n#Constipation (resolved): Constipated while in house without \ntaking\nopioids. Likely ___ immobility and also has urinary retention \nafter\nsurgery. Air fluid level with colonic ileus on KUB which \nresolved with large BM after aggressive bowel regimen. Would \nrecommend regular bowel regimen with decreased mobility. \n\n#UTI: Patient was found to have UTI at the OSH and was started \non ceftriaxone. Antibiotic course was completed on ___. \n\n# Fever (resolved) \nThe patient spiked fever to 101.3 on ___ with mild \nleukocytosis.\nUnclear etiology. Pt has been afebrile since. Infectious w/u \n(including Ua/UCx, CXR, blood cultures) was negative.\n\n#Cauda ___ s/p L4-5 laminectomy: Patient with acute \nrehabilitation needs and was evaluated by ___. Rehabilitation \ncomplicated by orthostatic hypotension as described above. MRI \nlumbar spine - second opinion ___ no hematoma, stable post-op \nchanges. Pain was well-controlled with Tylenol.\n\nTransitional Issues\n====================\n[] Patient being discharged to acute rehab at ___\n[] PE/DVTs: patient d/c'd on ___ SC for anticoagulation \n [] F/u with vascular medicine clinic at ___ as scheduled\n [] F/u with ___ clinic at ___ as scheduled\n[] Elevated transaminases: repeat LFTs within 1 week of \ndischarge. Consider further w/u as outpatient if persistently \nelevated\n[] Anxiety\n [] Uptitration of duloxetine PRN for mood\n [] Recommend outpatient enrollment in ___ partial \nprogram if patient still has needs\n[] L4/L5 laminectomy/discectomy\n [] Please call ___ for a Neurosurgery follow-up \n appointment with Dr. ___ in 4 weeks.\n[] Do not apply any lotions or creams to the surgical site\n[] Do not scrub surgical site\n\nCode status: FULL (presumed)\n#CONTACT: ___ (mother), ___\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

She presents with \nnausea/vomiting and inability to tolerate PO.  \n.  \nIn brief, she initially presented in ___ with pancytopenia \nand was ultimately diagnosed with a biphenotypic leukemia. She \nrecieved hyperCVAD part A and B. Bone marrow biopsy remained \npositive and she was treated with MEC. Marrow continued to show \nblasts and this was followed by clofarabine and Ara-C resulting \nin an empty marrow without evidence of leukemia. Her post- \nchemotherapy course was complicated by sepsis secondary to high \ngrade VRE bacteremia and coag negative staph bacteremia treated \nwith 4 weeks of daptomycin. She developed ATN and ultimately \nanuric renal failure requiring dialysis for ___ weeks. Her \nkidney function ostensibly recovered, she went to rehab and \nreturned, strengthened for her AlloSCT.  \n.  \nShe was discharged on Day ___ after a course that was complicated \nby severe mucositis and Coag-Neg staph bacteremia. Her counts \nrecovered, her mucositis improved. Her renal function slowly \nrose from ___ onward. This was attributed to a combination of \nimproving nutritional status and bulk, dehydration (the rise was \nconcomittant with the paring down of her enteral infusions) and \ndrug effect (?Tacrolimus, ?trimethoprim). On Day 27, she \npresented to ___ for a lab check. Her Cr had risen to 1.8, her \nplatelets fell from 190-120. A renal ultrasound found echogenic \nkidneys c/w medical renal disease and a theory was developed \nthat she had renal insufficiency ___ dehyrdration (inability to \ntolerate PO) and tacrolimus c/b tubular injury. She was \nrehydrated and her renal function improved.  \n.  \nShe now presents from clinic with continued nausea, vomiting, \nand inability to take PO.

Part B was complicated by  \nneutropenic fever. She was given two cycles of IT methotrexate,  \n\nher CNS did not have any evidence of disease. Repeat BM biopsy  \nshowed 40% blasts, was started on MEC, next BM biopsy showed a  \ndecrease to 20% blasts.

Degenerative changes of \nthe bilateral hips and lower lumbar spine. \nIMPRESSION:  \nMassively dilated stomach, as demonstrated on the same-day CT. \n\nCT Abdomen ___\n1. Limited examination without IV or oral contrast. Massively \ndilated stomach with mildly dilated proximal duodenum and \ndecompressed loops of bowel distally consistent with a gastric \noutlet obstruction. While the cause is not definitely seen there \nis a large amount of soft tissue density in the region of the a \nCBD stent and duodenum, which could be the culprit.\n2. Progression of pancreatic cancer with increase in size of the \npancreatic head mass which now abuts the midpole of the right \nkidney without a clear fat plane. There is likely also IVC \nextension.\n3. Right nephroureteral stent in place without evidence of \nhydronephrosis.\n4.

He was seen by nutrition for education on this \ndiet.\n\n# Metabolic Alkalosis: Patient presented with severe contraction \nalkalosis. Likely in the setting of vomitting secondary to \nobstruction. Resolved with IVF.  \n\n# Elevated lactate: Lactate was 3.3 on admission, improved to \n2.9 with IVF.  Etiology was likely multifactorial. Possibly due \nto hypoprofusion in setting of poor PO intake and hypotension. \nResolved with hydration\n\n# Acute Kidney Injury: Profound increase in creatinine.  His \npoor PO intake and vomitting may be contributing to a prerenal \npicture. Urine output was stable.  His creatine improved from \n4.6 to 3.8 with IVF.  After procedure he was able to maintain \nhis own hydration with IVF and Cr decreased to 1.2 which is is \nbaseline.\n \n# Coagulopathy: All coagulation factors were elevated, this was \ndue to nutritional deficits as well as progression of pancreatic \ndisease to liver. His INR improved with IV vitamin K which was \ngiven prior to GI procedure.   \n\n# GOC:  Spoke with patient's wife he reports that Mr. ___ was \non hospice and has decided to defer any further treatment of his \npancreatic cancer.

Chest x-ray and \nlaboratory testing did not reveal evidence of infection. \nPatient's mental status otherwise improved during the admission \nwithout intervention. Given ongoing concern for medication \neffect, a Psychiatry consultation was obtained, who recommended \nreducing quetiapine (due to patient's previously noted episodic \nsinus tachycardia), follow-up with outpatient sleep specialist, \nand considering alternatives to benzodiazepines for anxiety \nmanagement. These concerns were also discussed with patient's \nprimary care provider, who also expressed concerns regarding \npatient's opioid regimen, from which he was being weaned in the \nperiod preceding admission.\n\nWith respect to cardiac evaluation for syncope, transthoracic \nechocardiogram did not reveal concerning findings, and event \nmonitor was ordered prior to discharge.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n1.

Your mental \nstatus cleared following admission, and review of your EEG (both \nfrom before the hospitalization and during) preliminarily did \nnot show signs of seizures. Testing did not show signs of an \ninfection, and an ultrasound of your heart (echocardiogram) did \nnot show signs of severe heart valve disease that could have \nlimited blood flow to your brain. You were also fitted with an \nevent monitor prior to leaving the hospital to look for \narrhythmias.\n\nYou were also evaluated by the Psychiatry service, who \nrecommended decreasing your dose of quetiapine at night and \ntalking to your outpatient providers about switching from \nclonazepam to a different medication for your anxiety.

There is no evidence of \njoint effusion.\n \nImaged soft tissue structures are notable for an intrauterine \ndevice which\nappears centrally positioned within the uterus. Additionally, \nthere is a\nlarge hypodense cyst in the left adnexa, which measures 4.9 x \n4.0 x 4.2 cm\n(series 3, image 49).

At the time of presentation there was no \nnumbness, weakness or incontinence that would suggest cauda \nequina syndrome, and rectal tone was reported to be normal.  She \nwent on to develop numbness of the right labia.  An MRI was \nobtained to evaluate for possible cord compression.  The imaging \nrevealed an 8mm Tarlov cyst compressing the S2 nerve root, \nconsistent with the patient's distribution of pain and numbness. \n\n.\nNeurology and Neurosurgery consults were obtained, both of whom \ninitially recommended conservative management for pain control.  \nPain management declined to perform an S2 nerve block secondary \nto the risk of infection in an immunosuppressed individual.  The \npatient's symptoms did not improve with this conservative \napproach and her pain continued to worse.  The patient underwent \na S1-S2 bilateral laminectomy on ___.  She tolerated the \nprocedure well with no immediate complications.  She continued \nto have some pain following her operation, but it was much \nimproved.  She was able to ambulate well with the physical \ntherapist prior to discharge.\n.  \n# Mixed connective tissue disease/rheumatoid arthritis:  \nThe patient was evaluated by the rheumatologists who recommended \ncontinuing her home medications: prednisone and leflunomide.  \nThey felt her rheumatological diseases were stable and not \ncontributing to her current symptoms. \n.  \n# Recurrent osteomyelitis: \nThe patient recently finished IV antibiotic course for her \nrecurrent osteomyelitis and is currently on PO doxycycline for \nsuppression therapy, which was continued during this \nhospitalization.  \n.  \nChronic Medical Problems\n# Hypertension: Continued home meds, well controlled. \n# Asthma: Exercise-induced, patient reports symptoms stable.

Colonoscopy showed no abnormalities.  GI was \nconsulted during the admission.  They recommended H pylori \ntesting, which was negative, and capsule endoscopy to be \ncompleted as an outpatient for complete work up of GI bleed.  \nPatient instructed to schedule capsule endoscopy as outpatient.  \nPatient was continued on twice a day IV pantoprazole while \ninpatient and switched to oral regimen prior to discharge.   \nActive type and screen completed as well as two large bore iv's \nplaced on admission.  Trended patient's hematocrit daily.  \nBaseline Hct was difficult to determine as has fluctuated \ndramatically during previous hospitalizations, however remained \nstable through this hospitalization.  Iron studies, B12 and \nfolate all within normal limits.  The patient was on iron \ntherapy prior to admission, held per GI for colonoscopy ease.  \nThe patient was restarted on iron prior to discharge.  \nHaptoglobin was found to be less than 20 on three separate \noccasions.  This finding points towards hemolysis of unclear \netiology, however unknown significance in the setting of \nsplenectomy.  The patient was restarted on heparin drip \ninitially then coumadin when patient no longer reported melena \nor hematochezia.  We held the patient's aspirin during the \nhospitalization.  As discussed further below, the patient should \nhave a discussion with his primary care physician as to when to \nrestart aspirin therapy.  Propranolol was also held initially \ngiven the GI bleed, but restarted at home dose prior to \ndischarge.  \n.\n# Right-rib and abdominal pain s/p traumatic injury of fall:  We \nhad a low level of concern for intra-abdominal/subcapsular liver \ninjury with fall in setting of clinical appearance.  The \npatient's liver function tests were only mildly elevated and the \nhistory of alcohol use was definitely considered as the \netiology.  CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis did not show \nany sign of concerning retroperitoneal process, see discussion \nof CT findings below.  Pain most likely result of \nmusculoskeletal discomfort.  Pain resolved with tylenol only.  \nPatient asymptomatic prior to discharge. \n.  \n# CORONARIES:  Recent cardiac cath in ___ showed left dominant \nsystem revealed \nnonobstructive coronary disease, with no disease in the ___, \nminimal disease in the LAD, the LCX was dominant and had a long \n50% OM1 lesion and LPDA with minimal disease and the RCA with \ndiffuse disease.  No active ischemia evident on admission or \nduring hospitalization.  One set of cardiac enzymes negative.  \nAs above, aspirin was held during the hospitalization given the \nrecent GI bleed.  Given the patient has significant \nnon-obstructive coronary artery disease, the patient should be \nrestarted on aspirin therapy in the future.  Encouraged the \npatient to discuss this with his primary care doctor on follow \nup.  As above, initially held propranolol, however restarted \nduring hospitalization.  The patient reported he was taking \npropranolol only once daily, we restarted on TID regimen and \ndischarged the patient home with this regimen.  We also continue \nthe patient's home statin regimen.  \n.  \n# PUMP: The patient has a EF reduced by recent intra-operative \nTEE during most recent aortic valve replacement.  The patient \nwas monitored for signs of congestive heart failure and volume \noverload.  The patient remained euvolemic during the \nhospitalization and did not require diuretic therapy.  We \ncontinued the propanolol as above.   \n.  \n# RHYTHM: The patient has a history of sinus tachycardia, \nhowever remained in normal sinus rhythm during hospitalization.  \nHe was monitored continuously on telemetry.  The patient was \ncontinued on propranolol as above.\n.  \n# Mechanical AVR:  The patient has a history of congenital \nbicuspid aortic valve, s/p three valve replacements.  Most \nrecent valve is a St. ___ valve.  The patient was therapeutic \nwith regards to his coumadin dosing on admission, however \ncoumadin held for GI bleed.  Heparin drip was initiated, then \ncoumadin added when procedures completed.  The patient was \ninitially loaded with coumadin at a dose of 10mg per day, thus \nwas bridged for one day while INR therapeutic on heparin drip \nprior to discontinuing the heparin.  The patient was discharged \non his home dose of coumadin 4mg every day with the instruction \nto follow up with his ___ clinic for frequent checks.  We \nmonitored his INR daily while inpatient.  Patient was \ntherapeutic for two days prior to discharge.\n.  \n# Abdominal lymphadenopathy:  Patient had known abdominal \nlymphadenopathy in the setting of traumatic splenectomy.  The \npatient has been followed by Dr. ___ the lymphadenopathy. \n During his hospitalization a CT Abd Pelvis was completed for \nevaluation of flank pain and to monitor progression of \nlymphadenopathy.  A renal mass was noted on the CT scan.  \nUrology, Dr. ___, was consulted for further evaluation of \npossible urothelial malignancy.  While the patient was off \ncoumadin, a cystoscopy was performed.  The mass noted on CT scan \nwas noted on cystoscopy to be a prominent papilla of the renal \nparenchyma.  There was no evidence of urothelial malignancy on \nthe cystoscopy or by cytology of the bladder washings.  The \npatient did experience hematuria following the cystoscopy.  This \nwas as suspected as the patient although was not on coumadin, \nwas on heparin drip at the time of the procedure.  The patient \nhad no symptoms of dysuria, urgency, hesitancy or failure to \ncomplete voiding during the time of hematuria.  The patient was \ninstructed to follow up with Dr. ___ week of discharge.  \n\n.\n# Depression: Stable on admission.  Continued home regimen of \nlexapro throughout hospital course.  \n.  \n# EtOH abuse: Per patient's history, however alcohol level on \nadmission was zero.  We monitored the patient for signs of \nwithdrawal and maintained the patient on a CIWA scale, given his \nhistory of post-op delirium, however the patient did not require \nthe use of any benzodiazepines.  The patient was started on \nthiamine and folic acid on admission. This regimen was continued \nthroughout the hospitalization.\n.  \nFEN: The patient was maintained on a heart healthy, regular \ndiet.  Repleted electrolytes as needed.\n.  \nACCESS: two large bore peripheral IV's\n.  \nPROPHYLAXIS:  initially therapeutic on coumadin, then heparin \ndrip.\n.  \nCODE STATUS:  FULL\n.  \nCONTACT: Patient, daughter ___ ___  \n \n___ on Admission:\nAtorvastatin 40 mg  \nLexapro 20 mg  \npropanolol 10mg daily  \nranitidine 150 mg  \ncoumadin 4mg hs  \naspirin 81 mg  \niron sulfate 325  \nfolate 1 mg  \nmultivitamin\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

He was admitted to \nthe floor, where he continued to have elevated BPs (SBP \n180-200s) unresponsive to labetolol and IV hydralazine, so he \nwas transferred to the ICU for further management.\n\nWhile in the ICU, Mr. ___ SBPs ranged from 140-180s. He had \nno CP, n/v, or acute changes in vision. Heparin gtt was stopped \nin the setting of elevated BPs. His BPs gradually decreased on \nhis home blood pressure medications (lisinopril, hydralazine, \nlabetalol, nifedipine). His labetolol was temporarily held for \nepisodes of sinus bradycardia. Due to adequate control of his \nBP, he was not started on a nicardipine drip. There was concern \nfor left sided facial droop and slurred speech, so a CTA H\u0026N was \nordered, which was negative. He was evaluated by Neurology, who \nrecommended f/u MRI to r/o stroke, MAP\u003e65 for carotid stenosis, \nand EEG.\n\nHe underwent two sessions of dialysis with some improvement in \nhis BPs.

Presentation \nmost consistent with major depressive disorder with psychotic \nfeatures, however differential diagnosis also includes \nschizoaffective disorder and delusional disorder. She responded \nwell to being placed on Risperdal, with resolution of psychotic \nsymptoms and improvement in mood. She was discharged with new \noutpatient treaters and a partial program.\n\n2) Psychiatric:\n#Diagnoses/Differential:\n-Major Depressive Disorder with psychotic features\n-r/o schizoaffective disorder\n-r/o delusional disorder\n\nThe patient initially presented with multiple new onset \npsychotic features, including olfactory hallucinations \n(sweet/sour/peppery smells in her apartment), ideas of reference \n(that she was receiving messages from her ex-boyfriend through \nthe radio, news, and people wearing red or blue, interpreting \nthese as ways to \"play the game\" to find him), and thought \ninsertion, mostly in the context of symptoms of depression and \nanxiety surrounding her recent breakup with her boyfriend. Also \nwith suicidal ideation. This was the patient's first psychotic \nbreak, and in light of her olfactory hallucinations, an EEG was \nperformed to r/o temporal lobe epilepsy, and was negative. Other \norganic causes of psychosis essentially ruled out with negative \nCBC, LFTs, RPR, ___, and negative recent HIV test. Thus \npresentation was thought to be most consistent with major \ndepressive disorder w/ psychotic features (vs. schizoaffective \ndisorder vs. delusional disorder). She was placed on Risperdal \nin the ___, with almost immediate effect, and uptitrated to final \ndose of 4 mg qHS. She responded very well, with complete \ndissolution of her delusions, consistently denying any AH/VH/OH \nor IOR since admission to the unit. Endorsed SI in the ___, \nhowever on the unit she has no more SI. She refused initiation \nof Celexa in conjunction with the Risperdal, stating she did not \nfeel depressed and would only like to take the Risperdal at this \ntime, but will reconsider as outpatient. She expressed a \ncommitment to medication compliance as well as following up with \nher outpatient treaters.\n\nPatient was set up with new outpatient treaters, and is \nscheduled to see her therapist on ___, who will then refer to a \npsychiatrist. She was also set up with a Partial program at the \n___ starting with the beginning of her insurance. Group \ntherapy programs were also recommended to her.\n\n# Substance Use: No acute or chronic issues.\n\n3) Medical:\nThe following acute medical problems were addressed during this \nhospitalization:\n# Elevated WBC count with left shift: Initially presented with \nan elevated WBC count with left shift, however patient had \nnegative ROS, UA was negative. Repeat CBC was negative, thus \nlikely was due to a stress reaction.\n\n# Implanon removal: patient has stated she would like her \nImplanon removed, mainly because she believes it to have incited \nher psychotic symptoms. Literature search was negative for \nconnection between Implanon or active hormonal component and \npsychosis. Reinforced with the patient the lack of known \nconnection between Implanon and psychosis, and suggested that \nprocedure itself could have played role initiating psychotic \nsymptoms. She was instructed to follow up with her OB/GYN (with \nwhom she has an upcoming appointment) to have the Implanon \nremoved if she wishes.\n\nPatient was also instructed to make an appointment with her PCP \nfor ___.\n\n4) Legal/Safety:\nCV signed and accepted on admission, and pt remained on such \nthroughout the hospitalization.\n\nPt was calm and controlled on the unit. There were no \nsafety/behavioral issues. She was kept on standard Q15 minute \nchecks and unit restriction.\n\n5) Social/Milieu:\nPt was encouraged to participate in unit’s groups/milieu/therapy \nopportunities. She consistently attended groups and socialized \nwith peers, stating that she found great benefit in this, and \nenjoyed participating in the milieu. Family meeting was held \nwith patient's father and cousin, addressed medication \nquestions, relationship between Implanon and psychosis, and \naftercare plan. Family was quite supportive, warm, and \nunderstanding about the patient's condition and would like her \nto continue with medications as well as with outpatient \npsychiatrist/therapist.\n\n6) Disposition:\nPatient was discharged to her parents' house, with plans to \npursue nursing school again. She was optimistic about her \nfuture, and expressed commitment to medication compliance and \nfollowing up with her new outpatient treaters. Her family was \nvery supportive about the discharge plan. She was also very much \nlooking forward to seeing her daughter, who will be living with \nher and her parents now as well.\n\nFollow up was scheduled with therapist, partial program, PCP, \nand OB/GYN.\n\n7) Risk Assessment:\nAt this point in time, patient is euthymic and no longer having \nself-injurious thoughts and not at acutely elevated risk of harm \nto self/others or inadequate self-care, and therefore no longer \nin need of inpatient treatment.\n\nStatic risk factors include previous suicidal attempt, family \nhistory of schizophrenia. Modifiable risk factors include \nuntreated psychiatric illness which is now being treated with \nmedication, and set up with outpatient providers. Protective \nfactors include willingness to seek help, involved and \nsupportive family, child with whom patient has a good \nrelationship, ability to hold steady job, goals for going back \nto nursing school.\n \n8) Prognosis:\nPatient has a very good prognosis, primarily due to her \nwillingness to adhere to her treatment plan, her supportive \nfamily, and her high level of functioning prior to admission. \nHowever further exploration of her depression and suicidality in \nthe past, about which she was fairly guarded on this admission, \nwill be beneficial to the patient to further explore her coping \nmechanisms and thought patterns.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nNone.\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Initialy CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions, \nL\u003eR and possible LLL consolidation. Subsequent CXR showed \ncomplete white out of the left lung. She was treated empirically \nwith vancomycin and cefepime and a 5 day steroid burst. She also \nhad an elevated BNP implicating CHF in addition to possible \npneumonia with fever and LLL consolidation on CXR  - thus she \nwas diuresed with IV Lasix. A bronchoscopy was performed at \nbedside on ___ which removed a large mucus plug with \nimprovement in her oxygen saturations. Culture from BAL washings \ngrew MRSA so she was narrowed to vancomycin. She will completed \na ten day course of vancomycin on ___. Likely she had a viral \ninfection causing increased secretions and mucous plugging that \nshe was unable to clear. Further, she likely was colonized by \nMRSA given her positive swab in ___. \n\n# AF with RVR:\nRate poorly controlled at rehab just prior to admission. \nIntermittently off coumadin in the past with h/o GI bleeding.  \nPatient’s rate was difficult to control and blood pressures have \nbeen borderline-90s. Responded to metoprolol for rate control \nand we continued her coumadin dosing. She was discharged on \n100mg PO metoprolol succinate daily with a goal HR\u003c110 bpm.\n\n# systolic CHF:\nEF 35%. Medical management included IV diuresis for frank volume \noverload on admission. She was then transitioned to a stable \ndiuretic regimen of 20mg PO lasix daily. She was also continued \non metoprolol. She was not started on an ace inhibitor but would \nbenefit from one. Discharge weight 99 kg.\n\n# bilateral pleural effusions: \nLikely related to volume overload from CHF. Expect improvement \nwith continued diuresis with a stable diuretic regimen. Also \nwith contributions from an infectious process (had evidence of \nviral infection on CT scan). \n\n# pericardial effusion: \nHemodynamically insignificant. Pulsus between ___. \n\n# UTI: \nMRSA in urine culture. Unknown if patient symptomatic or \ncolonized from chronic foley catheter.\n\n# Anoxic encephalopathy and AMS: \nAltered on admission, most likely secondary to combination of \ninfection and possible CO2 retention and likely was unable to \ncompensate because of poor baseline. She was alert and oriented \nto name and hospital most days with confusion of the month/year. \nShe displayed poor memory and attention.\n\n# GERD: con't home PPI.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n=====================\n* schedule repeat EGD with GI for duodenal adenoma\n* repeat electrolytes on ___ and notify MD of results\n* uptitrate metoprolol if HR \u003e110 bpm for \u003e24hrs\n* monitor daily weights, weight on discharge was 99 kg. \n* optimization of heart failure regimen would include ace \ninhibitor, consider addition as tolerated\n* follow up pericardial and pleural effusions with imaging as \nindicated\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.
