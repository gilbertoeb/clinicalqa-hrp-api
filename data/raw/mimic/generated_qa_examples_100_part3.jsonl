Since he was in the hospital 1.5 months ago, he was \nput on antibiotics for HCAP vs aspiration PNA due to recent \nmultiple episodes of nausea/vomiting. Atypical PNA was also \nconsidered given the multifocal nature of PNA on CT scan. He \nreceived Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl and Levaquin, and was given \nboluses of IV fluids. Blood cultures, urine legionella antigen \nand urine strep pneumonia antigen were all NEGATIVE. . Patient \nhad persistent fevers while on medicine floor. Given \nimmunocompromised state on prednisone and infliximab, pulmonary \nwas consulted but did not suggest bronchoscopy as pt's symptoms \nand fevers improved shortly after Pulmonary consultation.  \nPatient's antibiotics were narrowed to levofloxacin only and he \ncompleted 7 days of antibiotics after his last fever on ___.\n\n# PULMONARY EMBOLISM:\nCT scan of chest on admission showed bilateral sub segmental \nPEs.  Patient was previously on dabigatran which was held given \nhis severe gastroparesis with retching due to bleeding risk in \npatient with low CHADS-2. After discussion with outpatient \nproviders it was decided to start the patient on warfarin \ninstead of a NOAC, as he has history of recurrent vomiting, with \nincreased risk for UGIB.  This is his ___ time VTE and appears \nunprovoked.  We recommend 3 months minimum of anticoagulation.  \nHe will need thrombophillia work-up and routine cancer \nscreening.  He had an echocardiogram that did NOT show any \nevidence of right heart strain.  He is being referred to the \n___ (multi-disciplinary pulmonary ___ clinic) and \nhas follow up scheduled in Hematology. INR on discharge 2.3\n\n# DELIRIUM\n# Altered mental status\nPatient was noted to have waxing and waning mental status, \nconsistent with delirium.  Unclear trigger for his delirium.  \nHead CT without bleed.  No new medications.  No evidence of new \ninfection.  No significant\nmetabolic derangement.  He was treated with a few dose of PRN \nZyprexa. He was seen by occupational therapy and was found to \nhave significant improvement in mental status. His mental status \nwas back to baseline prior to discharge.\n\n# FALL:\nWhile admitted the patient had an unwitnessed mechanical fall \nwhile anticoagulated. Patient was on telemetry when he tripped \nand no cardiac events occurred during that time. The patient \ninitially refused CT scans of head and neck and was able to \nverbalize and communicate the risk of intracranial hemorrhage \nincluding death. Patient's neurologic exam remained stable \nthroughout his hospitalization.  He ultimately had a CT Head \nthat did NOT show any bleed.\n\n# NAUSEA/VOMITING DUE TO GASTROPARESIS:\nPatient had extensive history of nausea/vomiting flares \noccurring 5x/year for the past ___ years. He has had extensive \nprior workup, including EGD, tryptase, C1-esterase, small bowel \nfollow through (SBFT); all were negative. He also had tried many \nmedications before this (amitriptyline, fexofenadine, \nerythromycin), which all failed. On admission, he was unable to \ntolerate PO due to gastroparesis. IV Zofran & Ativan were \ncontinued. ___ 2.5mg BID were continued.  He was seen by \nSwallow and SLP did not feel a video swallow or dietary \nmodifications needed.\n\n# ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS: \nContinued prednisome 5mg BID and calcium carbonate 500mg BID \nwith qmonthly Remicade injections. On admission, patient had \nsevere pain, so was started on IV dilaudid as needed. He was \nconverted to PO Dilaudid 2mg BID, which is reportedly a home \nmedication for him, prescribed by an outpatient MD. \n\n# AFIB: \nCHADS-2 score 2 (DM2, HTN), takes ASA 325mg at home. Was \ncontinued initially on home aspirin and diltiazem 240mg daily. \nWhile in the hospital, his home metoprolol succinate 100mg daily \nwas fractionated to metoprolol tartrate 25mg q6 hours.  His ASA \nwas reduced to 81mg once he was started on systemic \nanticoagulation for acute PE, as noted above.\n\nCHRONIC STABLE ISSUES:\n=====================================\n# T2DM - Reportedly steroid-induced. last A1C was 7.7 in ___\nContinued home Lantus, albeit at reduced dose given acute \nillness.  Mealtime blood sugar managed with SSI.\n\n# GERD: Continued home omeprazole, ranitidine \n \n# Depression/Anxiety: Continued home Fluoxetine 40 mg PO daily;  \n\n\n# Hyperlipidemia/CAD: Continued aspirin (reduced to 81mg now \nthat he is on systemic anticoagulation with VKA) and pravastatin \n40 mg PO QHS.  TTE this admission to eval for right heart strain \nshows preserved EF, no focal wall motion abnormality.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n1.  Repeat chest imaging with CT chest to document resolution of \ninfiltrates / multi-focal PNA, r/o underlying mass lesions\n2.  Dedicated MRI liver to eval abnormality seen incidentally on \nCTA Torso\n3.  INR monitoring and Coumadin dosing to be titrated, please \ncheck IN Rom ___.

Pulmonary vascular \ncongestion and mild cardiomegaly persists but mediastinal veins \nare less distended.\n\n___ Echocardiogram\nVery limited image quality. The left atrium is normal in size. \nLeft ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global \nsystolic function are normal (LVEF = 70%). Due to suboptimal \ntechnical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be \nfully excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left \nventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular \nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending \naorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets \ncannot be determined. The aortic valve is not well seen. There \nis no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. \nThe mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) \nmitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic \npressure could not be determined. The pulmonary artery is not \nwell visualized. There is a small pericardial effusion.

Since he was in the hospital 1.5 months ago, he was \nput on antibiotics for HCAP vs aspiration PNA due to recent \nmultiple episodes of nausea/vomiting. Atypical PNA was also \nconsidered given the multifocal nature of PNA on CT scan. He \nreceived Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl and Levaquin, and was given \nboluses of IV fluids. Blood cultures, urine legionella antigen \nand urine strep pneumonia antigen were all NEGATIVE. . Patient \nhad persistent fevers while on medicine floor. Given \nimmunocompromised state on prednisone and infliximab, pulmonary \nwas consulted but did not suggest bronchoscopy as pt's symptoms \nand fevers improved shortly after Pulmonary consultation.  \nPatient's antibiotics were narrowed to levofloxacin only and he \ncompleted 7 days of antibiotics after his last fever on ___.\n\n# PULMONARY EMBOLISM:\nCT scan of chest on admission showed bilateral sub segmental \nPEs.  Patient was previously on dabigatran which was held given \nhis severe gastroparesis with retching due to bleeding risk in \npatient with low CHADS-2. After discussion with outpatient \nproviders it was decided to start the patient on warfarin \ninstead of a NOAC, as he has history of recurrent vomiting, with \nincreased risk for UGIB.  This is his ___ time VTE and appears \nunprovoked.  We recommend 3 months minimum of anticoagulation.  \nHe will need thrombophillia work-up and routine cancer \nscreening.  He had an echocardiogram that did NOT show any \nevidence of right heart strain.  He is being referred to the \n___ (multi-disciplinary pulmonary ___ clinic) and \nhas follow up scheduled in Hematology. INR on discharge 2.3\n\n# DELIRIUM\n# Altered mental status\nPatient was noted to have waxing and waning mental status, \nconsistent with delirium.  Unclear trigger for his delirium.  \nHead CT without bleed.  No new medications.  No evidence of new \ninfection.  No significant\nmetabolic derangement.  He was treated with a few dose of PRN \nZyprexa. He was seen by occupational therapy and was found to \nhave significant improvement in mental status. His mental status \nwas back to baseline prior to discharge.\n\n# FALL:\nWhile admitted the patient had an unwitnessed mechanical fall \nwhile anticoagulated. Patient was on telemetry when he tripped \nand no cardiac events occurred during that time. The patient \ninitially refused CT scans of head and neck and was able to \nverbalize and communicate the risk of intracranial hemorrhage \nincluding death. Patient's neurologic exam remained stable \nthroughout his hospitalization.  He ultimately had a CT Head \nthat did NOT show any bleed.\n\n# NAUSEA/VOMITING DUE TO GASTROPARESIS:\nPatient had extensive history of nausea/vomiting flares \noccurring 5x/year for the past ___ years. He has had extensive \nprior workup, including EGD, tryptase, C1-esterase, small bowel \nfollow through (SBFT); all were negative. He also had tried many \nmedications before this (amitriptyline, fexofenadine, \nerythromycin), which all failed. On admission, he was unable to \ntolerate PO due to gastroparesis. IV Zofran & Ativan were \ncontinued. ___ 2.5mg BID were continued.  He was seen by \nSwallow and SLP did not feel a video swallow or dietary \nmodifications needed.\n\n# ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS: \nContinued prednisome 5mg BID and calcium carbonate 500mg BID \nwith qmonthly Remicade injections. On admission, patient had \nsevere pain, so was started on IV dilaudid as needed. He was \nconverted to PO Dilaudid 2mg BID, which is reportedly a home \nmedication for him, prescribed by an outpatient MD. \n\n# AFIB: \nCHADS-2 score 2 (DM2, HTN), takes ASA 325mg at home. Was \ncontinued initially on home aspirin and diltiazem 240mg daily. \nWhile in the hospital, his home metoprolol succinate 100mg daily \nwas fractionated to metoprolol tartrate 25mg q6 hours.  His ASA \nwas reduced to 81mg once he was started on systemic \nanticoagulation for acute PE, as noted above.\n\nCHRONIC STABLE ISSUES:\n=====================================\n# T2DM - Reportedly steroid-induced. last A1C was 7.7 in ___\nContinued home Lantus, albeit at reduced dose given acute \nillness.  Mealtime blood sugar managed with SSI.\n\n# GERD: Continued home omeprazole, ranitidine \n \n# Depression/Anxiety: Continued home Fluoxetine 40 mg PO daily;  \n\n\n# Hyperlipidemia/CAD: Continued aspirin (reduced to 81mg now \nthat he is on systemic anticoagulation with VKA) and pravastatin \n40 mg PO QHS.  TTE this admission to eval for right heart strain \nshows preserved EF, no focal wall motion abnormality.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n1.  Repeat chest imaging with CT chest to document resolution of \ninfiltrates / multi-focal PNA, r/o underlying mass lesions\n2.  Dedicated MRI liver to eval abnormality seen incidentally on \nCTA Torso\n3.  INR monitoring and Coumadin dosing to be titrated, please \ncheck IN Rom ___. Goal INR ___.  f/u for PE with Hematology  Will need thrombophilia work-up, \nup-to-date cancer screening and consider Hematology referral for \nw/u of unprovoked PE.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Pulmonary vascular \ncongestion and mild cardiomegaly persists but mediastinal veins \nare less distended.\n\n___ Echocardiogram\nVery limited image quality. The left atrium is normal in size. \nLeft ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and global \nsystolic function are normal (LVEF = 70%). Due to suboptimal \ntechnical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be \nfully excluded. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left \nventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular \nchamber size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending \naorta is mildly dilated. The number of aortic valve leaflets \ncannot be determined. The aortic valve is not well seen. There \nis no aortic valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. \nThe mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) \nmitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic \npressure could not be determined. The pulmonary artery is not \nwell visualized. There is a small pericardial effusion. There \nare no echocardiographic signs of tamponade.\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___ the \nfindings are grossly similar, but the technically suboptimal \nnature of both studies precludes definitive comparison.\n\n___ PA/LAT CXR\nIMPRESSION:\nIn comparison to chest radiograph of ___, multifocal \npoorly defined pulmonary opacities have progressed in the \ninterval including an ill-defined opacity in the left juxta \nhilar region and poorly defined nodular opacities in the right \nupper and mid lungs.  Left basilar atelectasis has improved.  No \npleural effusion.\n\n___ CT HEAD\nIMPRESSION:\n1.  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage\n2.

Since he was in the hospital 1.5 months ago, he was \nput on antibiotics for HCAP vs aspiration PNA due to recent \nmultiple episodes of nausea/vomiting. Atypical PNA was also \nconsidered given the multifocal nature of PNA on CT scan. He \nreceived Vanc/Cefepime/Flagyl and Levaquin, and was given \nboluses of IV fluids. Blood cultures, urine legionella antigen \nand urine strep pneumonia antigen were all NEGATIVE. . Patient \nhad persistent fevers while on medicine floor. Given \nimmunocompromised state on prednisone and infliximab, pulmonary \nwas consulted but did not suggest bronchoscopy as pt's symptoms \nand fevers improved shortly after Pulmonary consultation.  \nPatient's antibiotics were narrowed to levofloxacin only and he \ncompleted 7 days of antibiotics after his last fever on ___.\n\n# PULMONARY EMBOLISM:\nCT scan of chest on admission showed bilateral sub segmental \nPEs.  Patient was previously on dabigatran which was held given \nhis severe gastroparesis with retching due to bleeding risk in \npatient with low CHADS-2. After discussion with outpatient \nproviders it was decided to start the patient on warfarin \ninstead of a NOAC, as he has history of recurrent vomiting, with \nincreased risk for UGIB.  This is his ___ time VTE and appears \nunprovoked.  We recommend 3 months minimum of anticoagulation.  \nHe will need thrombophillia work-up and routine cancer \nscreening.  He had an echocardiogram that did NOT show any \nevidence of right heart strain.  He is being referred to the \n___ (multi-disciplinary pulmonary ___ clinic) and \nhas follow up scheduled in Hematology. INR on discharge 2.3\n\n# DELIRIUM\n# Altered mental status\nPatient was noted to have waxing and waning mental status, \nconsistent with delirium.  Unclear trigger for his delirium.  \nHead CT without bleed.  No new medications.  No evidence of new \ninfection.  No significant\nmetabolic derangement.  He was treated with a few dose of PRN \nZyprexa. He was seen by occupational therapy and was found to \nhave significant improvement in mental status. His mental status \nwas back to baseline prior to discharge.\n\n# FALL:\nWhile admitted the patient had an unwitnessed mechanical fall \nwhile anticoagulated. Patient was on telemetry when he tripped \nand no cardiac events occurred during that time. The patient \ninitially refused CT scans of head and neck and was able to \nverbalize and communicate the risk of intracranial hemorrhage \nincluding death. Patient's neurologic exam remained stable \nthroughout his hospitalization.  He ultimately had a CT Head \nthat did NOT show any bleed.\n\n# NAUSEA/VOMITING DUE TO GASTROPARESIS:\nPatient had extensive history of nausea/vomiting flares \noccurring 5x/year for the past ___ years. He has had extensive \nprior workup, including EGD, tryptase, C1-esterase, small bowel \nfollow through (SBFT); all were negative. He also had tried many \nmedications before this (amitriptyline, fexofenadine, \nerythromycin), which all failed. On admission, he was unable to \ntolerate PO due to gastroparesis. IV Zofran & Ativan were \ncontinued. ___ 2.5mg BID were continued.  He was seen by \nSwallow and SLP did not feel a video swallow or dietary \nmodifications needed.\n\n# ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS: \nContinued prednisome 5mg BID and calcium carbonate 500mg BID \nwith qmonthly Remicade injections. On admission, patient had \nsevere pain, so was started on IV dilaudid as needed. He was \nconverted to PO Dilaudid 2mg BID, which is reportedly a home \nmedication for him, prescribed by an outpatient MD. \n\n# AFIB: \nCHADS-2 score 2 (DM2, HTN), takes ASA 325mg at home. Was \ncontinued initially on home aspirin and diltiazem 240mg daily. \nWhile in the hospital, his home metoprolol succinate 100mg daily \nwas fractionated to metoprolol tartrate 25mg q6 hours.  His ASA \nwas reduced to 81mg once he was started on systemic \nanticoagulation for acute PE, as noted above.\n\nCHRONIC STABLE ISSUES:\n=====================================\n# T2DM - Reportedly steroid-induced. last A1C was 7.7 in ___\nContinued home Lantus, albeit at reduced dose given acute \nillness.  Mealtime blood sugar managed with SSI.\n\n# GERD: Continued home omeprazole, ranitidine \n \n# Depression/Anxiety: Continued home Fluoxetine 40 mg PO daily;  \n\n\n# Hyperlipidemia/CAD: Continued aspirin (reduced to 81mg now \nthat he is on systemic anticoagulation with VKA) and pravastatin \n40 mg PO QHS.  TTE this admission to eval for right heart strain \nshows preserved EF, no focal wall motion abnormality.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n1.  Repeat chest imaging with CT chest to document resolution of \ninfiltrates / multi-focal PNA, r/o underlying mass lesions\n2.  Dedicated MRI liver to eval abnormality seen incidentally on \nCTA Torso\n3.  INR monitoring and Coumadin dosing to be titrated, please \ncheck IN Rom ___.

She was \nadmitted to the MICU given her hypotension (SBP 70-80s). Stool \ndisimpaction was performed aggressively multiple times with \nretrieval of a large amount of stool, which was trace guaiac \npositive. However, despite this, her lactate continued to trend \nup (from 3.7 to 5.8) and she remained hypotensive despite \ngenerous fluid resuscitation. She had received 4L prior to her \nMICU admission and received a further 3L while in the ICU but \nwas still requiring levophed. She received empiric vanc/zosyn, \nas well as IV flagyl for coverage of c diff empirically. The ACS \nservice was consulted for consideration of ischemic colitis as \npotential source of rising lactate and persistent hypotension. \nHer exam was concerning for abdominal distension and apparent \ndiscomfort with abdominal palpation, and CT was suggestive of \npossible ischemic colitis related to massive dilaion of bowel \nwith stool. They thought her sepsis was likely due to a urinary \nsource rather than ischemic bowel, and did not think surgical \nintervention was indicated. Overnight, her lactate continued \ntrend up with increasing pressor requirements. Urine and blood \ncultures remained negative.

She was \nadmitted to the MICU given her hypotension (SBP 70-80s). Stool \ndisimpaction was performed aggressively multiple times with \nretrieval of a large amount of stool, which was trace guaiac \npositive. However, despite this, her lactate continued to trend \nup (from 3.7 to 5.8) and she remained hypotensive despite \ngenerous fluid resuscitation. She had received 4L prior to her \nMICU admission and received a further 3L while in the ICU but \nwas still requiring levophed. She received empiric vanc/zosyn, \nas well as IV flagyl for coverage of c diff empirically. The ACS \nservice was consulted for consideration of ischemic colitis as \npotential source of rising lactate and persistent hypotension. \nHer exam was concerning for abdominal distension and apparent \ndiscomfort with abdominal palpation, and CT was suggestive of \npossible ischemic colitis related to massive dilaion of bowel \nwith stool. They thought her sepsis was likely due to a urinary \nsource rather than ischemic bowel, and did not think surgical \nintervention was indicated. Overnight, her lactate continued \ntrend up with increasing pressor requirements. Urine and blood \ncultures remained negative. Her family decided to make her CMO \nand she expired shortly after.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1. Mirtazapine 15 mg PO HS \n2.

There is a \nlarge left pelvic adnexal cyst as demonstrated earlier. This now \nmeasures 7.5 cm x 5.8 cm in greatest dimension in transverse \nsection, probably unchanged. There is evidence for septation \nalong the medial aspect of this lesion.  Pelvic structures are \notherwise unremarkable.  No free fluid is noted.

At ___ a nasogastric tube was placed, \nand labs were all unremarkable, with a normal lactate. She was \nmade NPO and IVF were begun. On arrival to ___ ED, her \nabdominal pain, nausea and vomiting had improved, and on exam \nshe had a non-acute abdomen. She had a bowel movement the \nmorning of admission, and was passing flatus. Given her \nnon-actue abdomen without clinical signs of obstruction, the \ndecision was made not to go to the operating room for treatment \nof her radiologic intussesception. She was admitted overnight \nand received a \"banana bag,\" IVF, with NGT left in overnight. \nNutrition labs were sent and were all normal, with thiamine \npending on discharge. NGT was removed on HD2. The patient was \ngiven the option to follow up at ___ for \npotential future revision of her bypass, or at ___. She \nelected to follow up at the ___ Bariatric Surgery \nprogram for ongoing management, and was given the necessary \nenrollment forms on discharge. Of note, she did present with a \ndepressed mood and frustrated with her nausea/abdominal pain for \nthe past ___ years since her bypass: she was evaluated by the \nPsychiatry service, who determined she has major depressive \ndisorder, and recommended she begin Remeron 7.5 mg qhs.

No \nspontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the \nleft atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is \nseen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic \nfunction is depressed. The right ventricular cavity is dilated \nwith global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal diastolic \nseptal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume \noverload. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta, \naortic arch, and descending thoracic aorta. A mechanical aortic \nvalve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis \nleaflets appear to move normally. Trace aortic regurgitation is \nseen. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. \nThere is posterior mitral valve leaflet restriction with \nmoderate (2+) mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is \nseen on the mitral valve. There is no pericardial effusion.\nIMPRESSION: Posterior mitral leaflet restriction with moderate \nMR. ___ and hypokinetic RV with evidence of RV volume \noverload. Depressed LF systolic function. Well-seated mechanical \naortic valve. Poor RV and tricuspid valve visualization.\n  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe findings are similar. RV and tricuspid valve are better seen \non the previous transthoracic echocardiogram. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ woman with a past medical history of Hodgkin's \nLymphoma ___ years ago, S/P radiation treatment and chemotherapy, \nnow with tetra-valvular disease and known CAD S/P CABG + \nmechanical aortic valve replacement and mitral and tricuspid \nvalve repair on warfarin admitted for evaluation of worsening \nright sided heart failure with right heart catheterization and \nfor heparin drip bridging while holding Coumadin.\n\n# CAD: Known 2 vessel disease from ___ angiography, S/P CABG x \n1 (saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery) in ___. We \ndecreased patient's dose of Metoprolol tartrate 100mg BID \n(discharged on 100 mg metoprolol succinate) to allow for more \nblood pressure room for diuresis. We also continued simvastatin \n40 mg Tablet daily and aspirin 81 mg Tablet daily.\n\n# Pump: Severe biventricular systolic heart failure with LVEF = \n35-40%, evidence of elevated right heart pressures from \noutpatient transthroacic echocardiogram. Right heart \ncatheterization demonstrated large PCW V waves consistent with \nsignifican mitral regurgitation, along with mean PCW 25 mm Hg, \nconsistent with acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic \nheart failure. Follow up TEE showed only 2+ moderate mitral \nregurgitation. Medical management for now as benefit of mitral \nvalve surgery uncertain. We changed her enalapril 10 mg daily to \nlisinopril 5 mg daily to achieve more blood pressure room to \nallow for torsemide 50 mg daily (patient was on 40 mg tablet \ndaily initially but a week prior to coming into the hospital she \nwas on 50 mg). While in house, patient regularly had blood \npressures in the 80-90s systolic range, which was asymptomatic, \nhowever, in an effort to diurese the patient and reduce her \nPCWP, we made the blood pressure medication changes as above.\n\n# Rhythm: LBBB on EKG. Disynchronous beating by echo, but likely \nto right sided increased pressures and failure. Otherwise not \nactive issue.\n\n# Valvular heart disease, S/P mechanical AVR: On warfarin at \nhome. We restarted warfarin ___, 5 mg daily, with INR 2.5 at \ndischarge. Goal INR of 2.5-3.5, when patient was subtherapeutic, \nshe was on a heparin drip.\n\n# Cough: upper respiratory tract infection versus dry room. Less \nlikely is strep throat as patient is afebrile. Patient with some \ncoughing and pink tinged sputum which is likely exacerbated by \nwarfarin and heparin. She is not having pain with swallowing and \nhad a runny nose while in house. No chest pain or cough from \nlungs. Afebrile. Patient was given Cepacol, Tylenol and Tessalon \nPerles PRN.\n\n# Lymphoma from age ___. s/p radiation. Otherwise not active.\n\n# History of depression: Controlled with citalopram 20 mg daily.\n\n# Iron deficinecy: patient not anemic now, MCV 95, we continued \nher outpatient iron preparation.\n\n# Transitional\n-We decreased patient's blood pressure medications to allow more \nroom for diuresis.  As mentioned, patient was asymptomatic, but \nwill continue to benefit from diuresis in light of her PCWP of \napproximately 28.

No \nspontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the \nleft atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is \nseen by 2D or color Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic \nfunction is depressed. The right ventricular cavity is dilated \nwith global free wall hypokinesis. There is abnormal diastolic \nseptal motion/position consistent with right ventricular volume \noverload. There are simple atheroma in the ascending aorta, \naortic arch, and descending thoracic aorta. A mechanical aortic \nvalve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis \nleaflets appear to move normally. Trace aortic regurgitation is \nseen. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic valve. \nThere is posterior mitral valve leaflet restriction with \nmoderate (2+) mitral regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is \nseen on the mitral valve. There is no pericardial effusion.\nIMPRESSION: Posterior mitral leaflet restriction with moderate \nMR. ___ and hypokinetic RV with evidence of RV volume \noverload. Depressed LF systolic function. Well-seated mechanical \naortic valve. Poor RV and tricuspid valve visualization.\n  Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe findings are similar. RV and tricuspid valve are better seen \non the previous transthoracic echocardiogram. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ woman with a past medical history of Hodgkin's \nLymphoma ___ years ago, S/P radiation treatment and chemotherapy, \nnow with tetra-valvular disease and known CAD S/P CABG + \nmechanical aortic valve replacement and mitral and tricuspid \nvalve repair on warfarin admitted for evaluation of worsening \nright sided heart failure with right heart catheterization and \nfor heparin drip bridging while holding Coumadin.\n\n# CAD: Known 2 vessel disease from ___ angiography, S/P CABG x \n1 (saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery) in ___. We \ndecreased patient's dose of Metoprolol tartrate 100mg BID \n(discharged on 100 mg metoprolol succinate) to allow for more \nblood pressure room for diuresis. We also continued simvastatin \n40 mg Tablet daily and aspirin 81 mg Tablet daily.\n\n# Pump: Severe biventricular systolic heart failure with LVEF = \n35-40%, evidence of elevated right heart pressures from \noutpatient transthroacic echocardiogram. Right heart \ncatheterization demonstrated large PCW V waves consistent with \nsignifican mitral regurgitation, along with mean PCW 25 mm Hg, \nconsistent with acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic \nheart failure. Follow up TEE showed only 2+ moderate mitral \nregurgitation. Medical management for now as benefit of mitral \nvalve surgery uncertain. We changed her enalapril 10 mg daily to \nlisinopril 5 mg daily to achieve more blood pressure room to \nallow for torsemide 50 mg daily (patient was on 40 mg tablet \ndaily initially but a week prior to coming into the hospital she \nwas on 50 mg). While in house, patient regularly had blood \npressures in the 80-90s systolic range, which was asymptomatic, \nhowever, in an effort to diurese the patient and reduce her \nPCWP, we made the blood pressure medication changes as above.\n\n# Rhythm: LBBB on EKG. Disynchronous beating by echo, but likely \nto right sided increased pressures and failure. Otherwise not \nactive issue.\n\n# Valvular heart disease, S/P mechanical AVR: On warfarin at \nhome. We restarted warfarin ___, 5 mg daily, with INR 2.5 at \ndischarge. Goal INR of 2.5-3.5, when patient was subtherapeutic, \nshe was on a heparin drip.\n\n# Cough: upper respiratory tract infection versus dry room. Less \nlikely is strep throat as patient is afebrile. Patient with some \ncoughing and pink tinged sputum which is likely exacerbated by \nwarfarin and heparin. She is not having pain with swallowing and \nhad a runny nose while in house. No chest pain or cough from \nlungs. Afebrile. Patient was given Cepacol, Tylenol and Tessalon \nPerles PRN.\n\n# Lymphoma from age ___. s/p radiation. Otherwise not active.\n\n# History of depression: Controlled with citalopram 20 mg daily.\n\n# Iron deficinecy: patient not anemic now, MCV 95, we continued \nher outpatient iron preparation.\n\n# Transitional\n-We decreased patient's blood pressure medications to allow more \nroom for diuresis.  As mentioned, patient was asymptomatic, but \nwill continue to benefit from diuresis in light of her PCWP of \napproximately 28. As an outpatient, these changes can certainly \nbe reversed.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nAMOXICILLIN - 500 mg Capsule - 4 Capsule(s) by mouth 1 hour \nprior to dental work\nCITALOPRAM - 20 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily\nENALAPRIL MALEATE - 10 mg Tablet - one Tablet(s) by mouth daily\nIRON POLYSACCH COMPLEX-B12-FA [FERREX ___ FORTE] - 150 mg-25 \nmcg-1 mg Capsule - 1 Capsule(s) by mouth twice a day with meals\nLORAZEPAM - 0.5 mg Tablet - 1 (One) Tablet(s) by mouth only as \nneeded as needed for as needed for anxiety or wheezing\nMETOPROLOL SUCCINATE - 200 mg Tablet Extended Release 24 hr - 1 \nTablet(s) by mouth once a day\nNITROGLYCERIN - 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual - 1 Tablet \nsublingually every 5 minutes for chest pain only up to 3 tablets\nSIMVASTATIN - 40 mg Tablet - 1 Tablet(s) by mouth daily\nTORSEMIDE - 20 mg Tablet - TWO Tablet(s) by mouth once a day\nWARFARIN - 5 mg Tablet - one Tablet(s) by mouth daily on \n___ 4 mg the rest of week\nWARFARIN - 1 mg Tablet - one-half Tablet by mouth once per week \nwith 4 mg tab; 5mg on ___ & 4mg rest of week (has 4mg & 5mg \ntabs)\nWARFARIN - 2 mg Tablet - two Tablet(s) by mouth five days a \nweek; 5mg tablet on ___ 4.5mg on ___\nASPIRIN [ENTERIC COATED ASPIRIN] - (Prescribed by Other \nProvider) - 81 mg Tablet, Delayed Release (E.C.) - 1 Tablet(s) \nby mouth Daily \n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. amoxicillin 500 mg Capsule Sig: Four (4) Capsule PO Once: \nPlease take 1 hour prior to dental work.\n2. citalopram 20 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\n3. iron polysacch complex-B12-FA 150-25-1 mg-mcg-mg Capsule Sig: \nOne (1) Capsule PO twice a day: with meals.\n4. lorazepam 0.5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO every eight \n(8) hours as needed: for anxiety.\n5. nitroglycerin 0.4 mg Tablet, Sublingual Sig: One (1)  \nSublingual three times a day: Can take up to 3 for chest pain, 5 \nminutes apart.

We \ndecreased patient's dose of Metoprolol tartrate 100mg BID \n(discharged on 100 mg metoprolol succinate) to allow for more \nblood pressure room for diuresis. We also continued simvastatin \n40 mg Tablet daily and aspirin 81 mg Tablet daily.\n\n# Pump: Severe biventricular systolic heart failure with LVEF = \n35-40%, evidence of elevated right heart pressures from \noutpatient transthroacic echocardiogram. Right heart \ncatheterization demonstrated large PCW V waves consistent with \nsignifican mitral regurgitation, along with mean PCW 25 mm Hg, \nconsistent with acute on chronic left ventricular diastolic \nheart failure. Follow up TEE showed only 2+ moderate mitral \nregurgitation. Medical management for now as benefit of mitral \nvalve surgery uncertain. We changed her enalapril 10 mg daily to \nlisinopril 5 mg daily to achieve more blood pressure room to \nallow for torsemide 50 mg daily (patient was on 40 mg tablet \ndaily initially but a week prior to coming into the hospital she \nwas on 50 mg). While in house, patient regularly had blood \npressures in the 80-90s systolic range, which was asymptomatic, \nhowever, in an effort to diurese the patient and reduce her \nPCWP, we made the blood pressure medication changes as above.\n\n# Rhythm: LBBB on EKG. Disynchronous beating by echo, but likely \nto right sided increased pressures and failure. Otherwise not \nactive issue.\n\n# Valvular heart disease, S/P mechanical AVR: On warfarin at \nhome. We restarted warfarin ___, 5 mg daily, with INR 2.5 at \ndischarge. Goal INR of 2.5-3.5, when patient was subtherapeutic, \nshe was on a heparin drip.\n\n# Cough: upper respiratory tract infection versus dry room. Less \nlikely is strep throat as patient is afebrile. Patient with some \ncoughing and pink tinged sputum which is likely exacerbated by \nwarfarin and heparin. She is not having pain with swallowing and \nhad a runny nose while in house. No chest pain or cough from \nlungs. Afebrile. Patient was given Cepacol, Tylenol and Tessalon \nPerles PRN.\n\n# Lymphoma from age ___. s/p radiation. Otherwise not active.\n\n# History of depression: Controlled with citalopram 20 mg daily.\n\n# Iron deficinecy: patient not anemic now, MCV 95, we continued \nher outpatient iron preparation.\n\n# Transitional\n-We decreased patient's blood pressure medications to allow more \nroom for diuresis.

Extensive edema and sulcal effacement of the entire right \nhemisphere. \n3. Marked encephalomalacia of the entire left cerebral \nhemisphere \n\nCT head ___\nIMPRESSION: Overall increase in size of the large right \nparenchymal \nhemorrhage, now 7 x 5.9 cm, with increased leftward shift of \nmidline \nstructures, now 2.8 cm, and worsening uncal herniation with new \ncompression \nand leftward deviation of the midbrain. Increased size of the \noccipital horn \nand atrium of the left lateral ventricle concerning for \n\"trapping\" of this \nventricle. New left hemispheric subarachnoid and unchanged \nintraventricular \nhemorrhage. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ year old man with history of AF, HTN, \nhyperlipidemia, and s/p\nan old left MCA infarct with residual aphasia and mild right \nsided weakness.  He was found confused, then suddenly collapsed \nper his wife earlier today.  He was taken to ___ \n___, where head CT showed an ICH. He was intubated, loaded \nwith phosphenytoin & treated with vitamin K for presumed \ncoagulopathy; then transferred to ___ for surgical management \nof his ICH.\n.\nUpon transfer from the outside hospital, the patient was \ninitially evaluated by the neurosurgery service in regards to a \npossible right temporoparietal craniotomy.  In lengthy \ndiscussion with the neurosurgery service and neurology service, \nthe family decided against surgical intervention as they did not \nwant the patient to suffer.  \n.\nThe neurology service was asked to see him urgently by \nNeurosurgery to assist with ICH management and to render our \nopinion regarding the futility of surgical intervention.  At \ntime of examination, the patient had no spontaneous movement and \ndid not respond to voice.  He had a mild gag reflex. Pupils were \nsmall ~ 1 to 1.5 mm but reactive.  Eyes were midline.  He had \ncorneals bilaterally.  Doll's eye was not elicited.  He moved \nthe right side to pain & nasal stimulation. He postures on the \nleft in response to pain.  Toes were upgoing. Overall, his GCS \nwas 4.  Head CT showed a large right parenchymal ICH with IVH \nand extension into the brainstem, midline shift of ~ 22mm, and \nventricular dilatation in addition to an old left\ntemporo-parietal infarct. \n.\nOverall, the cause of his ICH was difficult to ascertain.  It is \nlikely hypertensive, but one cannot entirely rule out a \nsecondary cause.  Regardless, his prognosis appeared grim. His \nICH score was 4, indicating a 30-day mortality of ~ 97%.  \nMultiple members of the neurology and neurosurgery service had \nlengthy discussions with multiple family members regarding his \ncondition, expected prognosis, and treatment options.  His \nchances for any meaningful recovery, if he survives, are \nminimal.  While surgery could be life-saving, it is unlikely to \nimprove his functional outcome. They decided on a DNR status, \nbut wanted to\ndiscuss the surgical option with Dr. ___ further.  They \nwere initially inclined to proceed with surgery, but later \nreversed their decision.\n.\nThe patient was admitted to the NSICU for medical management.  A \nrepeat CT head several hours after arrival revealed worsening \nhemorrhage with midline shift and uncal herniation.  Social work \nconsult was requested to help the family cope with the difficult \nsituation and after further discussions, the patient was \nultimately made CMO.

He was admitted to \nthe floor, where he continued to have elevated BPs (SBP \n180-200s) unresponsive to labetolol and IV hydralazine, so he \nwas transferred to the ICU for further management.\n\nWhile in the ICU, Mr. ___ SBPs ranged from 140-180s. He had \nno CP, n/v, or acute changes in vision. Heparin gtt was stopped \nin the setting of elevated BPs. His BPs gradually decreased on \nhis home blood pressure medications (lisinopril, hydralazine, \nlabetalol, nifedipine). His labetolol was temporarily held for \nepisodes of sinus bradycardia. Due to adequate control of his \nBP, he was not started on a nicardipine drip. There was concern \nfor left sided facial droop and slurred speech, so a CTA H&N was \nordered, which was negative.

You received an MRI of your \n___ which showed evidence of an old stroke, but no new strokes. \nThere was concern for blood stream infection so you were treated \nwith intravenous antibiotics.\n- You underwent numerous tests, including multiple ultrasounds \nof your heart (echocardiograms). These showed signs of regional \nmotion problems likely due to coronary artery disease (narrowing \nof the blood vessels around the heart). However, you did not \nundergo stenting given the likely chronic nature of your heart \ndisease and due to concern for your gastrointestinal bleeding.\n- You underwent regular hemodialysis on ___, and \n___ as scheduled.\n- During this admission, you were also nauseous and vomiting \nblood. To evaluate the source of the bleeding, you were seen by \nthe gastroenterologists and taken for esophagoduodenoscopy (EGD \nor \"upper endoscopy\"), and were found to have esophagitis \n(inflammation of the tube connecting your mouth to your stomach) \nand 2 different ulcers, one of which had a blood vessel that was \nclipped to prevent bleeding. you also had evidence of \ninflammation in your duodenum. For your ulcers, you were started \non the medication pantoprazole.\n-You were treated with intravenous antibiotics for suspicion for \na bloodstream infection, a soft tissue infection at the site of \nyour AV fistula, and a urinary tract infection.\n-You developed diarrhea and were found to have C. difficile \ninfection, for which you were started on treatment with oral \nvancomycin.\n-You were also found to have difficulty speaking, and were \nevaluated by the speech language pathology team.\n-You were found to have masses in both of your parotid glands \n(the largest glands in your cheeks that make saliva), which will \nrequire follow-up as an outpatient.\n\nWhat should I do after leaving the hospital?  \n-  Please take your medications as listed in discharge summary \nand follow up at the listed appointments. \n\nThank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish \nyou all the best!  \n\nSincerely,\n\nYour ___ Healthcare Team  \n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___", "question": "What allergies does the patient have?", "answer_text": "Depakote / Seroquel", "answer_start": 112}

He was admitted to \nthe floor, where he continued to have elevated BPs (SBP \n180-200s) unresponsive to labetolol and IV hydralazine, so he \nwas transferred to the ICU for further management.\n\nWhile in the ICU, Mr. ___ SBPs ranged from 140-180s. He had \nno CP, n/v, or acute changes in vision. Heparin gtt was stopped \nin the setting of elevated BPs. His BPs gradually decreased on \nhis home blood pressure medications (lisinopril, hydralazine, \nlabetalol, nifedipine). His labetolol was temporarily held for \nepisodes of sinus bradycardia. Due to adequate control of his \nBP, he was not started on a nicardipine drip. There was concern \nfor left sided facial droop and slurred speech, so a CTA H&N was \nordered, which was negative. He was evaluated by Neurology, who \nrecommended f/u MRI to r/o stroke, MAP>65 for carotid stenosis, \nand EEG.\n\nHe underwent two sessions of dialysis with some improvement in \nhis BPs.

Due \nto your elevated blood pressure, you were found to be having a \nnon ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (a kind of heart \nattack), which did not progress further after your blood \npressure was under better control. You received an MRI of your \n___ which showed evidence of an old stroke, but no new strokes. \nThere was concern for blood stream infection so you were treated \nwith intravenous antibiotics.\n- You underwent numerous tests, including multiple ultrasounds \nof your heart (echocardiograms). These showed signs of regional \nmotion problems likely due to coronary artery disease (narrowing \nof the blood vessels around the heart). However, you did not \nundergo stenting given the likely chronic nature of your heart \ndisease and due to concern for your gastrointestinal bleeding.\n- You underwent regular hemodialysis on ___, and \n___ as scheduled.\n- During this admission, you were also nauseous and vomiting \nblood. To evaluate the source of the bleeding, you were seen by \nthe gastroenterologists and taken for esophagoduodenoscopy (EGD \nor \"upper endoscopy\"), and were found to have esophagitis \n(inflammation of the tube connecting your mouth to your stomach) \nand 2 different ulcers, one of which had a blood vessel that was \nclipped to prevent bleeding. you also had evidence of \ninflammation in your duodenum. For your ulcers, you were started \non the medication pantoprazole.\n-You were treated with intravenous antibiotics for suspicion for \na bloodstream infection, a soft tissue infection at the site of \nyour AV fistula, and a urinary tract infection.\n-You developed diarrhea and were found to have C. difficile \ninfection, for which you were started on treatment with oral \nvancomycin.\n-You were also found to have difficulty speaking, and were \nevaluated by the speech language pathology team.\n-You were found to have masses in both of your parotid glands \n(the largest glands in your cheeks that make saliva), which will \nrequire follow-up as an outpatient.\n\nWhat should I do after leaving the hospital?  \n-  Please take your medications as listed in discharge summary \nand follow up at the listed appointments. \n\nThank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish \nyou all the best!  \n\nSincerely,\n\nYour ___ Healthcare Team  \n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___", "question": "What major surgical or invasive procedure did the patient undergo?", "answer_text": "EGD", "answer_start": 166}

He was admitted to \nthe floor, where he continued to have elevated BPs (SBP \n180-200s) unresponsive to labetolol and IV hydralazine, so he \nwas transferred to the ICU for further management.\n\nWhile in the ICU, Mr. ___ SBPs ranged from 140-180s. He had \nno CP, n/v, or acute changes in vision. Heparin gtt was stopped \nin the setting of elevated BPs. His BPs gradually decreased on \nhis home blood pressure medications (lisinopril, hydralazine, \nlabetalol, nifedipine). His labetolol was temporarily held for \nepisodes of sinus bradycardia. Due to adequate control of his \nBP, he was not started on a nicardipine drip. There was concern \nfor left sided facial droop and slurred speech, so a CTA H&N was \nordered, which was negative. He was evaluated by Neurology, who \nrecommended f/u MRI to r/o stroke, MAP>65 for carotid stenosis, \nand EEG.\n\nHe underwent two sessions of dialysis with some improvement in \nhis BPs. Of note, he has been on vanc w/ HD due to blood \ncultures from ___ HD unit growing GPCs \n(unconfirmed sensitivities). He has a wound culture from ___ \ngrowing MSSA; however unclear what was cultured, and requires \nf/u with OSH.\n\nGiven improvement in BPs, he is now being transferred back to \nthe medicine floor, he continues to deny headache, CP, SOB, n/v, \nor acute changes in vision.

Due \nto your elevated blood pressure, you were found to be having a \nnon ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (a kind of heart \nattack), which did not progress further after your blood \npressure was under better control. You received an MRI of your \n___ which showed evidence of an old stroke, but no new strokes. \nThere was concern for blood stream infection so you were treated \nwith intravenous antibiotics.\n- You underwent numerous tests, including multiple ultrasounds \nof your heart (echocardiograms). These showed signs of regional \nmotion problems likely due to coronary artery disease (narrowing \nof the blood vessels around the heart). However, you did not \nundergo stenting given the likely chronic nature of your heart \ndisease and due to concern for your gastrointestinal bleeding.\n- You underwent regular hemodialysis on ___, and \n___ as scheduled.\n- During this admission, you were also nauseous and vomiting \nblood. To evaluate the source of the bleeding, you were seen by \nthe gastroenterologists and taken for esophagoduodenoscopy (EGD \nor \"upper endoscopy\"), and were found to have esophagitis \n(inflammation of the tube connecting your mouth to your stomach) \nand 2 different ulcers, one of which had a blood vessel that was \nclipped to prevent bleeding. you also had evidence of \ninflammation in your duodenum. For your ulcers, you were started \non the medication pantoprazole.\n-You were treated with intravenous antibiotics for suspicion for \na bloodstream infection, a soft tissue infection at the site of \nyour AV fistula, and a urinary tract infection.\n-You developed diarrhea and were found to have C. difficile \ninfection, for which you were started on treatment with oral \nvancomycin.\n-You were also found to have difficulty speaking, and were \nevaluated by the speech language pathology team.\n-You were found to have masses in both of your parotid glands \n(the largest glands in your cheeks that make saliva), which will \nrequire follow-up as an outpatient.\n\nWhat should I do after leaving the hospital?  \n-  Please take your medications as listed in discharge summary \nand follow up at the listed appointments. \n\nThank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish \nyou all the best!  \n\nSincerely,\n\nYour ___ Healthcare Team  \n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___", "question": "What was the patient's chief complaint upon admission?", "answer_text": "AMS, HTN", "answer_start": 140}

He was admitted to \nthe floor, where he continued to have elevated BPs (SBP \n180-200s) unresponsive to labetolol and IV hydralazine, so he \nwas transferred to the ICU for further management.\n\nWhile in the ICU, Mr. ___ SBPs ranged from 140-180s. He had \nno CP, n/v, or acute changes in vision. Heparin gtt was stopped \nin the setting of elevated BPs. His BPs gradually decreased on \nhis home blood pressure medications (lisinopril, hydralazine, \nlabetalol, nifedipine). His labetolol was temporarily held for \nepisodes of sinus bradycardia. Due to adequate control of his \nBP, he was not started on a nicardipine drip. There was concern \nfor left sided facial droop and slurred speech, so a CTA H&N was \nordered, which was negative. He was evaluated by Neurology, who \nrecommended f/u MRI to r/o stroke, MAP>65 for carotid stenosis, \nand EEG.\n\nHe underwent two sessions of dialysis with some improvement in \nhis BPs. Of note, he has been on vanc w/ HD due to blood \ncultures from ___ HD unit growing GPCs \n(unconfirmed sensitivities).

Due \nto your elevated blood pressure, you were found to be having a \nnon ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (a kind of heart \nattack), which did not progress further after your blood \npressure was under better control. You received an MRI of your \n___ which showed evidence of an old stroke, but no new strokes. \nThere was concern for blood stream infection so you were treated \nwith intravenous antibiotics.\n- You underwent numerous tests, including multiple ultrasounds \nof your heart (echocardiograms). These showed signs of regional \nmotion problems likely due to coronary artery disease (narrowing \nof the blood vessels around the heart). However, you did not \nundergo stenting given the likely chronic nature of your heart \ndisease and due to concern for your gastrointestinal bleeding.\n- You underwent regular hemodialysis on ___, and \n___ as scheduled.\n- During this admission, you were also nauseous and vomiting \nblood. To evaluate the source of the bleeding, you were seen by \nthe gastroenterologists and taken for esophagoduodenoscopy (EGD \nor \"upper endoscopy\"), and were found to have esophagitis \n(inflammation of the tube connecting your mouth to your stomach) \nand 2 different ulcers, one of which had a blood vessel that was \nclipped to prevent bleeding. you also had evidence of \ninflammation in your duodenum. For your ulcers, you were started \non the medication pantoprazole.\n-You were treated with intravenous antibiotics for suspicion for \na bloodstream infection, a soft tissue infection at the site of \nyour AV fistula, and a urinary tract infection.\n-You developed diarrhea and were found to have C. difficile \ninfection, for which you were started on treatment with oral \nvancomycin.\n-You were also found to have difficulty speaking, and were \nevaluated by the speech language pathology team.\n-You were found to have masses in both of your parotid glands \n(the largest glands in your cheeks that make saliva), which will \nrequire follow-up as an outpatient.\n\nWhat should I do after leaving the hospital?  \n-  Please take your medications as listed in discharge summary \nand follow up at the listed appointments. \n\nThank you for allowing us to be involved in your care, we wish \nyou all the best!  \n\nSincerely,\n\nYour ___ Healthcare Team  \n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___", "question": "What condition was the patient experiencing that led to their transfer to the ICU?", "answer_text": "hypertensive emergency", "answer_start": 317}

He was admitted to \nthe floor, where he continued to have elevated BPs (SBP \n180-200s) unresponsive to labetolol and IV hydralazine, so he \nwas transferred to the ICU for further management.\n\nWhile in the ICU, Mr. ___ SBPs ranged from 140-180s. He had \nno CP, n/v, or acute changes in vision. Heparin gtt was stopped \nin the setting of elevated BPs. His BPs gradually decreased on \nhis home blood pressure medications (lisinopril, hydralazine, \nlabetalol, nifedipine). His labetolol was temporarily held for \nepisodes of sinus bradycardia. Due to adequate control of his \nBP, he was not started on a nicardipine drip. There was concern \nfor left sided facial droop and slurred speech, so a CTA H&N was \nordered, which was negative. He was evaluated by Neurology, who \nrecommended f/u MRI to r/o stroke, MAP>65 for carotid stenosis, \nand EEG.\n\nHe underwent two sessions of dialysis with some improvement in \nhis BPs.

Low \nCD4 puts her at increased risk for cryptosporidium, MAC, \nisospora, microsporidium, CMV and giardia, however, her diarrhea \nimproved and her fevers resolved. She has had no recent HAART \nmedication changes. Also, given low CD4, inflitrative diseases \nsuch as Kaposi and lymphoma should remain on the ddx, though \nless likely, given acuity. Additionally she has known multiple \ncolonic diverticuli and she may have developed diverticulitis, \nhowever she had no further fevers during this hospitalization \nand her abdominal exam was benign and inconsistent with \ndiverticulitis. Stool studies were negative to date; blood \nculture was also negative to date and we discontinued empiric \ncipro/flagyl per ID recommendations on consultation, given that \nher diarrhea and fevers resolved and clinically she looked so \nwell.  She was discharged with close ID follow-up.\n \n#HIV/AIDS: CD4 of 24 on ___ we continued darunavin stribild, \nas well as azithromycin and atovaquone ppx given CD4 count. \n\n___: mild Cr elevation likely in the setting of poor po intake \na fluid lossess from diarrhea is s/p IVF In ED.

She had good urine output \nand was discharged with outpatient labs to be done the week \nfollowing didscharge for a creatinine check.\n  \n# Transaminitis: Improved. This was a new problem for her, ratio \nof elevation is most consistent with alcholic hepatocellular \ndamage, however, she denies etoh.

In an immune \nsuppressed patient with diarrhea and elevated transaminases and \nAlkphos, it is improtant to consider MAC, however, given her \nclinical picture, this was thought to be less likely.  \n \n# Anemia: normocytic anemia with normal RDW that appears to be \nat baseline since ___, likely secondary to chronic disease. \nTbili normal and no evidence of schistocytes, so hemolysis from \nan infectious process less likely. This remained stable \nthroughout her admission.\n  \n# Monocytosis: Resolved. not uncommon in the setting of \ninflammatory states and AI conditions and corticosteroid \nexposure.

She has had no recent HAART \nmedication changes. Also, given low CD4, inflitrative diseases \nsuch as Kaposi and lymphoma should remain on the ddx, though \nless likely, given acuity. Additionally she has known multiple \ncolonic diverticuli and she may have developed diverticulitis, \nhowever she had no further fevers during this hospitalization \nand her abdominal exam was benign and inconsistent with \ndiverticulitis.

Low \nCD4 puts her at increased risk for cryptosporidium, MAC, \nisospora, microsporidium, CMV and giardia, however, her diarrhea \nimproved and her fevers resolved. She has had no recent HAART \nmedication changes. Also, given low CD4, inflitrative diseases \nsuch as Kaposi and lymphoma should remain on the ddx, though \nless likely, given acuity. Additionally she has known multiple \ncolonic diverticuli and she may have developed diverticulitis, \nhowever she had no further fevers during this hospitalization \nand her abdominal exam was benign and inconsistent with \ndiverticulitis. Stool studies were negative to date; blood \nculture was also negative to date and we discontinued empiric \ncipro/flagyl per ID recommendations on consultation, given that \nher diarrhea and fevers resolved and clinically she looked so \nwell.  She was discharged with close ID follow-up.\n \n#HIV/AIDS: CD4 of 24 on ___ we continued darunavin stribild, \nas well as azithromycin and atovaquone ppx given CD4 count. \n\n___: mild Cr elevation likely in the setting of poor po intake \na fluid lossess from diarrhea is s/p IVF In ED. Cr initially \nimproved with IVF, however, then plateaued at a value of 1.4 \nwhich was above her baseline of 0.8. Urine lytes yielded a FeNa \nof 2.2%, with granular casts on her urine sediment,  suggestive \nof ATN in the setting of dehydration. She had good urine output \nand was discharged with outpatient labs to be done the week \nfollowing didscharge for a creatinine check.\n  \n# Transaminitis: Improved. This was a new problem for her, ratio \nof elevation is most consistent with alcholic hepatocellular \ndamage, however, she denies etoh. Could also be from infectious \nillness which is being worked up as above. In an immune \nsuppressed patient with diarrhea and elevated transaminases and \nAlkphos, it is improtant to consider MAC, however, given her \nclinical picture, this was thought to be less likely.  \n \n# Anemia: normocytic anemia with normal RDW that appears to be \nat baseline since ___, likely secondary to chronic disease. \nTbili normal and no evidence of schistocytes, so hemolysis from \nan infectious process less likely. This remained stable \nthroughout her admission.\n  \n# Monocytosis: Resolved. not uncommon in the setting of \ninflammatory states and AI conditions and corticosteroid \nexposure. Also known to accompany conditions associated with \nneutropenia, thought to be compensatory. Infectiuons may also be \nassociated with moncytosis. Monocytosis may also be seen in \ncertain malignancies, such as lymphomas.  \n\n****TRANSITIONAL ISSUES****\n- patient discharged with a Creatinine of 1.4 (from high of \n1.8), which is above a recent baseline of 0.8. FeNa and urine \nsediment with granular casts. She was discharged with a script \nto have a creatinine checked shortly after discharge for close \nfollow-up. PCP should receive these results and follow-up. If \nstill elevated, she may benefit from Renal evaluation\n- Question of non-adherence to HAART and prophylactic abx should \nbe addressed, given low CD4 count.

No focal liver \nlesion is identified. No biliary dilatation is seen and the \ncommon duct measures 0.3 cm. The gallbladder is normal in \nappearance with no gallstones. The pancreas and aorta are \nobscured from view by overlying bowel gas. The spleen is again \nnoted to be enlarged measuring 13.8 cm, unchanged from the prior \nultrasound. No hydronephrosis is seen on limited views of the  \nkidneys. No ascites is seen in the abdomen.\nDOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color Doppler and spectral waveform \nanalysis was performed. The main, right and left portal veins \nare patent with hepatopetal flow. Appropriate arterial waveforms \nare seen in the main hepatic artery. The hepatic veins are \npatent and the splenic vein is patent at the splenic hilum.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No biliary obstruction and no focal liver lesion identified.\n2. Patent hepatic vasculature.\n3. Stable splenomegaly.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ man with H/O methamphetamine induced dilated \ncardiomyopathy (LVEF 35% in ___ hepatitis C, HIV (history of \nnon-compliance with HAART), polysubstance abuse, DVT on Coumadin \n(___) which was discontinued due to noncompliance in ___ who presents as planned direct admission arranged by \ncardiology clinic with orthostasis, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, \nand acute renal failure (baseline cr=0.9).\n\nAcute Renal Failure:\nPatient had recent lab values consistent with acute renal \nfailure. His blood urea nitrogen was 70 and creatinine was 2.3, \nsuggestive of a prerenal etiology for his acute renal failure. \nFurther supporting this diagnosis was the fact that the patient \nhad recently been taking torsemide and having his dose decreased \nsecondary to polyuria over the past month. Upon arrival to the \nfloor, the patient had not taken any of his medications \nprescribed for heart failure with the exception of metoprolol. \nIn the absence of torsemide, the patient's serum transaminases \nand serum creatinine slightly decreased. The patient was given a \n500 mL bolus of normal saline and he ate a regular meal for \ndinner without fluid restrictions. By withholding the loop \ndiuretic and repleting intravascular volume, his sodium, \npotassium, and creatinine normalized the following day. As a \nresult, all of the patient's medications with the exception of \nmetoprolol were held. Given that the patient has systolic heart \nfailure, he will need restarted on these medications. It is \nlikely that his medication regimen was escalated slightly too \naggressively and needs to retitrated.  \n- The patient has follow-up labs which will be drawn in 2 days, \nand he has an appointment with his primary care physician who \ncan review the laboratory values and reassess the patient\u2019s \nmedications.\n- The patient also has an appointment with his out patient \ncardiologist in 6 days. During that visit, Dr. ___  ___ \nre-titrate the patient\u2019s medications for optimal cardiac \nsecondary and primary prevention.\n\nElevated AST/ALT:  \n- Patient presented with market elevations in his serum \ntransaminases. Our differential for this diagnosis was broad. \nGiven his past history of DVT, there was a concern of hepatic \nvenous thrombosis. This was excluded by his right upper quadrant \nDoppler ultrasound study. Congestive hepatopathy is also an \nunlikely diagnosis given that the patient was clinically \neuvolaemic or even hypovolemic upon presentation. A viral \netiology for his liver enzyme abnormalities could not be ruled \nout given the patient's HIV and hepatitis C. Hepatology was \nconsulted and they felt like the most likely cause of his \nelevated liver enzymes was due to hypoperfusion. Once the \npatient was given back volume, his liver enzymes trended down \nslightly (but were still markedly elevated). His primary care \nphysician ___ check his LFTs on ___ and should abnormalities \nstill persist then outpatient referral to a hepatologist may be \nwarranted.\nRecommendations per hepatology consult:\n1. Continue to monitor LFTs until recovery to baseline.\n2. F/u HCV viral load q 6 months \n3. Maintain adequate blood pressure and avoid systemic arterial \nhypotension\n4. OK to do trial of Atripla once his LFTs normalize.\n\nChronic left ventricular systolic heart failure.\nEchocardiogram performed the day prior to admission showed LVEF \n35%-40%. There was mild to moderate global left ventricular \nhypokinesis with normal cavity size. Mildly dilated right \nventricular cavity with mild free wall hypokinesis.

No focal liver \nlesion is identified. No biliary dilatation is seen and the \ncommon duct measures 0.3 cm. The gallbladder is normal in \nappearance with no gallstones. The pancreas and aorta are \nobscured from view by overlying bowel gas. The spleen is again \nnoted to be enlarged measuring 13.8 cm, unchanged from the prior \nultrasound. No hydronephrosis is seen on limited views of the  \nkidneys. No ascites is seen in the abdomen.\nDOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color Doppler and spectral waveform \nanalysis was performed. The main, right and left portal veins \nare patent with hepatopetal flow. Appropriate arterial waveforms \nare seen in the main hepatic artery. The hepatic veins are \npatent and the splenic vein is patent at the splenic hilum.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No biliary obstruction and no focal liver lesion identified.\n2. Patent hepatic vasculature.\n3. Stable splenomegaly.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ man with H/O methamphetamine induced dilated \ncardiomyopathy (LVEF 35% in ___ hepatitis C, HIV (history of \nnon-compliance with HAART), polysubstance abuse, DVT on Coumadin \n(___) which was discontinued due to noncompliance in ___ who presents as planned direct admission arranged by \ncardiology clinic with orthostasis, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, \nand acute renal failure (baseline cr=0.9).\n\nAcute Renal Failure:\nPatient had recent lab values consistent with acute renal \nfailure. His blood urea nitrogen was 70 and creatinine was 2.3, \nsuggestive of a prerenal etiology for his acute renal failure. \nFurther supporting this diagnosis was the fact that the patient \nhad recently been taking torsemide and having his dose decreased \nsecondary to polyuria over the past month. Upon arrival to the \nfloor, the patient had not taken any of his medications \nprescribed for heart failure with the exception of metoprolol. \nIn the absence of torsemide, the patient's serum transaminases \nand serum creatinine slightly decreased. The patient was given a \n500 mL bolus of normal saline and he ate a regular meal for \ndinner without fluid restrictions. By withholding the loop \ndiuretic and repleting intravascular volume, his sodium, \npotassium, and creatinine normalized the following day. As a \nresult, all of the patient's medications with the exception of \nmetoprolol were held. Given that the patient has systolic heart \nfailure, he will need restarted on these medications. It is \nlikely that his medication regimen was escalated slightly too \naggressively and needs to retitrated.  \n- The patient has follow-up labs which will be drawn in 2 days, \nand he has an appointment with his primary care physician who \ncan review the laboratory values and reassess the patient\u2019s \nmedications.\n- The patient also has an appointment with his out patient \ncardiologist in 6 days. During that visit, Dr. ___  ___ \nre-titrate the patient\u2019s medications for optimal cardiac \nsecondary and primary prevention.\n\nElevated AST/ALT:  \n- Patient presented with market elevations in his serum \ntransaminases. Our differential for this diagnosis was broad. \nGiven his past history of DVT, there was a concern of hepatic \nvenous thrombosis. This was excluded by his right upper quadrant \nDoppler ultrasound study. Congestive hepatopathy is also an \nunlikely diagnosis given that the patient was clinically \neuvolaemic or even hypovolemic upon presentation. A viral \netiology for his liver enzyme abnormalities could not be ruled \nout given the patient's HIV and hepatitis C. Hepatology was \nconsulted and they felt like the most likely cause of his \nelevated liver enzymes was due to hypoperfusion. Once the \npatient was given back volume, his liver enzymes trended down \nslightly (but were still markedly elevated). His primary care \nphysician ___ check his LFTs on ___ and should abnormalities \nstill persist then outpatient referral to a hepatologist may be \nwarranted.\nRecommendations per hepatology consult:\n1. Continue to monitor LFTs until recovery to baseline.\n2. F/u HCV viral load q 6 months \n3. Maintain adequate blood pressure and avoid systemic arterial \nhypotension\n4. OK to do trial of Atripla once his LFTs normalize.\n\nChronic left ventricular systolic heart failure.\nEchocardiogram performed the day prior to admission showed LVEF \n35%-40%. There was mild to moderate global left ventricular \nhypokinesis with normal cavity size. Mildly dilated right \nventricular cavity with mild free wall hypokinesis. Compared \nwith the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the left \nventricular cavity is less dilated, the global function is \nimproved, and the degree of mitral regurgitation is decreased. \nHe was continued on his beta-blocker.\n\nIn summary: the patient presented to ___ 3 generally feeling \nwell.

No focal liver \nlesion is identified. No biliary dilatation is seen and the \ncommon duct measures 0.3 cm. The gallbladder is normal in \nappearance with no gallstones. The pancreas and aorta are \nobscured from view by overlying bowel gas. The spleen is again \nnoted to be enlarged measuring 13.8 cm, unchanged from the prior \nultrasound. No hydronephrosis is seen on limited views of the  \nkidneys. No ascites is seen in the abdomen.\nDOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color Doppler and spectral waveform \nanalysis was performed. The main, right and left portal veins \nare patent with hepatopetal flow. Appropriate arterial waveforms \nare seen in the main hepatic artery. The hepatic veins are \npatent and the splenic vein is patent at the splenic hilum.\nIMPRESSION:\n1. No biliary obstruction and no focal liver lesion identified.\n2. Patent hepatic vasculature.\n3. Stable splenomegaly.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ man with H/O methamphetamine induced dilated \ncardiomyopathy (LVEF 35% in ___ hepatitis C, HIV (history of \nnon-compliance with HAART), polysubstance abuse, DVT on Coumadin \n(___) which was discontinued due to noncompliance in ___ who presents as planned direct admission arranged by \ncardiology clinic with orthostasis, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, \nand acute renal failure (baseline cr=0.9).\n\nAcute Renal Failure:\nPatient had recent lab values consistent with acute renal \nfailure. His blood urea nitrogen was 70 and creatinine was 2.3, \nsuggestive of a prerenal etiology for his acute renal failure. \nFurther supporting this diagnosis was the fact that the patient \nhad recently been taking torsemide and having his dose decreased \nsecondary to polyuria over the past month. Upon arrival to the \nfloor, the patient had not taken any of his medications \nprescribed for heart failure with the exception of metoprolol. \nIn the absence of torsemide, the patient's serum transaminases \nand serum creatinine slightly decreased. The patient was given a \n500 mL bolus of normal saline and he ate a regular meal for \ndinner without fluid restrictions. By withholding the loop \ndiuretic and repleting intravascular volume, his sodium, \npotassium, and creatinine normalized the following day. As a \nresult, all of the patient's medications with the exception of \nmetoprolol were held. Given that the patient has systolic heart \nfailure, he will need restarted on these medications. It is \nlikely that his medication regimen was escalated slightly too \naggressively and needs to retitrated.  \n- The patient has follow-up labs which will be drawn in 2 days, \nand he has an appointment with his primary care physician who \ncan review the laboratory values and reassess the patient\u2019s \nmedications.\n- The patient also has an appointment with his out patient \ncardiologist in 6 days. During that visit, Dr. ___  ___ \nre-titrate the patient\u2019s medications for optimal cardiac \nsecondary and primary prevention.\n\nElevated AST/ALT:  \n- Patient presented with market elevations in his serum \ntransaminases. Our differential for this diagnosis was broad. \nGiven his past history of DVT, there was a concern of hepatic \nvenous thrombosis. This was excluded by his right upper quadrant \nDoppler ultrasound study. Congestive hepatopathy is also an \nunlikely diagnosis given that the patient was clinically \neuvolaemic or even hypovolemic upon presentation. A viral \netiology for his liver enzyme abnormalities could not be ruled \nout given the patient's HIV and hepatitis C. Hepatology was \nconsulted and they felt like the most likely cause of his \nelevated liver enzymes was due to hypoperfusion. Once the \npatient was given back volume, his liver enzymes trended down \nslightly (but were still markedly elevated). His primary care \nphysician ___ check his LFTs on ___ and should abnormalities \nstill persist then outpatient referral to a hepatologist may be \nwarranted.\nRecommendations per hepatology consult:\n1. Continue to monitor LFTs until recovery to baseline.\n2. F/u HCV viral load q 6 months \n3. Maintain adequate blood pressure and avoid systemic arterial \nhypotension\n4. OK to do trial of Atripla once his LFTs normalize.\n\nChronic left ventricular systolic heart failure.\nEchocardiogram performed the day prior to admission showed LVEF \n35%-40%. There was mild to moderate global left ventricular \nhypokinesis with normal cavity size. Mildly dilated right \nventricular cavity with mild free wall hypokinesis. Compared \nwith the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, the left \nventricular cavity is less dilated, the global function is \nimproved, and the degree of mitral regurgitation is decreased. \nHe was continued on his beta-blocker.\n\nIn summary: the patient presented to ___ 3 generally feeling \nwell. He has been able to walk his dogs several miles a day \nwithout chest pain or shortness of breath. His appetite was good \nand the patient was in good spirits during his hospitalization. \nHis lab abnormalities began to correct in the setting of holding \nhis medications (with the exception of his beta blocker) and \nputting the patient on a regular diet. \n \nMedications on Admission:\n1.

Colonoscopy showed no abnormalities.  GI was \nconsulted during the admission.  They recommended H pylori \ntesting, which was negative, and capsule endoscopy to be \ncompleted as an outpatient for complete work up of GI bleed.  \nPatient instructed to schedule capsule endoscopy as outpatient.  \nPatient was continued on twice a day IV pantoprazole while \ninpatient and switched to oral regimen prior to discharge.   \nActive type and screen completed as well as two large bore iv's \nplaced on admission.  Trended patient's hematocrit daily.  \nBaseline Hct was difficult to determine as has fluctuated \ndramatically during previous hospitalizations, however remained \nstable through this hospitalization.  Iron studies, B12 and \nfolate all within normal limits.  The patient was on iron \ntherapy prior to admission, held per GI for colonoscopy ease.  \nThe patient was restarted on iron prior to discharge.  \nHaptoglobin was found to be less than 20 on three separate \noccasions.  This finding points towards hemolysis of unclear \netiology, however unknown significance in the setting of \nsplenectomy.  The patient was restarted on heparin drip \ninitially then coumadin when patient no longer reported melena \nor hematochezia.  We held the patient's aspirin during the \nhospitalization.  As discussed further below, the patient should \nhave a discussion with his primary care physician as to when to \nrestart aspirin therapy.  Propranolol was also held initially \ngiven the GI bleed, but restarted at home dose prior to \ndischarge.  \n.\n# Right-rib and abdominal pain s/p traumatic injury of fall:  We \nhad a low level of concern for intra-abdominal/subcapsular liver \ninjury with fall in setting of clinical appearance.  The \npatient's liver function tests were only mildly elevated and the \nhistory of alcohol use was definitely considered as the \netiology.  CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis did not show \nany sign of concerning retroperitoneal process, see discussion \nof CT findings below.  Pain most likely result of \nmusculoskeletal discomfort.  Pain resolved with tylenol only.  \nPatient asymptomatic prior to discharge. \n.  \n# CORONARIES:  Recent cardiac cath in ___ showed left dominant \nsystem revealed \nnonobstructive coronary disease, with no disease in the ___, \nminimal disease in the LAD, the LCX was dominant and had a long \n50% OM1 lesion and LPDA with minimal disease and the RCA with \ndiffuse disease.  No active ischemia evident on admission or \nduring hospitalization.  One set of cardiac enzymes negative.  \nAs above, aspirin was held during the hospitalization given the \nrecent GI bleed.  Given the patient has significant \nnon-obstructive coronary artery disease, the patient should be \nrestarted on aspirin therapy in the future.  Encouraged the \npatient to discuss this with his primary care doctor on follow \nup.  As above, initially held propranolol, however restarted \nduring hospitalization.  The patient reported he was taking \npropranolol only once daily, we restarted on TID regimen and \ndischarged the patient home with this regimen.  We also continue \nthe patient's home statin regimen.  \n.  \n# PUMP: The patient has a EF reduced by recent intra-operative \nTEE during most recent aortic valve replacement.  The patient \nwas monitored for signs of congestive heart failure and volume \noverload.  The patient remained euvolemic during the \nhospitalization and did not require diuretic therapy.  We \ncontinued the propanolol as above.   \n.  \n# RHYTHM: The patient has a history of sinus tachycardia, \nhowever remained in normal sinus rhythm during hospitalization.  \nHe was monitored continuously on telemetry.  The patient was \ncontinued on propranolol as above.\n.  \n# Mechanical AVR:  The patient has a history of congenital \nbicuspid aortic valve, s/p three valve replacements.  Most \nrecent valve is a St. ___ valve.  The patient was therapeutic \nwith regards to his coumadin dosing on admission, however \ncoumadin held for GI bleed.  Heparin drip was initiated, then \ncoumadin added when procedures completed.  The patient was \ninitially loaded with coumadin at a dose of 10mg per day, thus \nwas bridged for one day while INR therapeutic on heparin drip \nprior to discontinuing the heparin.  The patient was discharged \non his home dose of coumadin 4mg every day with the instruction \nto follow up with his ___ clinic for frequent checks.  We \nmonitored his INR daily while inpatient.  Patient was \ntherapeutic for two days prior to discharge.\n.  \n# Abdominal lymphadenopathy:  Patient had known abdominal \nlymphadenopathy in the setting of traumatic splenectomy.  The \npatient has been followed by Dr. ___ the lymphadenopathy. \n During his hospitalization a CT Abd Pelvis was completed for \nevaluation of flank pain and to monitor progression of \nlymphadenopathy.  A renal mass was noted on the CT scan.  \nUrology, Dr. ___, was consulted for further evaluation of \npossible urothelial malignancy.  While the patient was off \ncoumadin, a cystoscopy was performed.  The mass noted on CT scan \nwas noted on cystoscopy to be a prominent papilla of the renal \nparenchyma.  There was no evidence of urothelial malignancy on \nthe cystoscopy or by cytology of the bladder washings.  The \npatient did experience hematuria following the cystoscopy.  This \nwas as suspected as the patient although was not on coumadin, \nwas on heparin drip at the time of the procedure.  The patient \nhad no symptoms of dysuria, urgency, hesitancy or failure to \ncomplete voiding during the time of hematuria.  The patient was \ninstructed to follow up with Dr. ___ week of discharge.  \n\n.\n# Depression: Stable on admission.  Continued home regimen of \nlexapro throughout hospital course.  \n.  \n# EtOH abuse: Per patient's history, however alcohol level on \nadmission was zero.  We monitored the patient for signs of \nwithdrawal and maintained the patient on a CIWA scale, given his \nhistory of post-op delirium, however the patient did not require \nthe use of any benzodiazepines.  The patient was started on \nthiamine and folic acid on admission. This regimen was continued \nthroughout the hospitalization.\n.  \nFEN: The patient was maintained on a heart healthy, regular \ndiet.  Repleted electrolytes as needed.\n.  \nACCESS: two large bore peripheral IV's\n.  \nPROPHYLAXIS:  initially therapeutic on coumadin, then heparin \ndrip.\n.  \nCODE STATUS:  FULL\n.  \nCONTACT: Patient, daughter ___ ___  \n \n___ on Admission:\nAtorvastatin 40 mg  \nLexapro 20 mg  \npropanolol 10mg daily  \nranitidine 150 mg  \ncoumadin 4mg hs  \naspirin 81 mg  \niron sulfate 325  \nfolate 1 mg  \nmultivitamin\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Colonoscopy showed no abnormalities.  GI was \nconsulted during the admission.  They recommended H pylori \ntesting, which was negative, and capsule endoscopy to be \ncompleted as an outpatient for complete work up of GI bleed.  \nPatient instructed to schedule capsule endoscopy as outpatient.  \nPatient was continued on twice a day IV pantoprazole while \ninpatient and switched to oral regimen prior to discharge.   \nActive type and screen completed as well as two large bore iv's \nplaced on admission.  Trended patient's hematocrit daily.  \nBaseline Hct was difficult to determine as has fluctuated \ndramatically during previous hospitalizations, however remained \nstable through this hospitalization.  Iron studies, B12 and \nfolate all within normal limits.  The patient was on iron \ntherapy prior to admission, held per GI for colonoscopy ease.  \nThe patient was restarted on iron prior to discharge.  \nHaptoglobin was found to be less than 20 on three separate \noccasions.  This finding points towards hemolysis of unclear \netiology, however unknown significance in the setting of \nsplenectomy.  The patient was restarted on heparin drip \ninitially then coumadin when patient no longer reported melena \nor hematochezia.  We held the patient's aspirin during the \nhospitalization.  As discussed further below, the patient should \nhave a discussion with his primary care physician as to when to \nrestart aspirin therapy.  Propranolol was also held initially \ngiven the GI bleed, but restarted at home dose prior to \ndischarge.  \n.\n# Right-rib and abdominal pain s/p traumatic injury of fall:  We \nhad a low level of concern for intra-abdominal/subcapsular liver \ninjury with fall in setting of clinical appearance.  The \npatient's liver function tests were only mildly elevated and the \nhistory of alcohol use was definitely considered as the \netiology.  CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis did not show \nany sign of concerning retroperitoneal process, see discussion \nof CT findings below.  Pain most likely result of \nmusculoskeletal discomfort.  Pain resolved with tylenol only.  \nPatient asymptomatic prior to discharge. \n.  \n# CORONARIES:  Recent cardiac cath in ___ showed left dominant \nsystem revealed \nnonobstructive coronary disease, with no disease in the ___, \nminimal disease in the LAD, the LCX was dominant and had a long \n50% OM1 lesion and LPDA with minimal disease and the RCA with \ndiffuse disease.  No active ischemia evident on admission or \nduring hospitalization.  One set of cardiac enzymes negative.  \nAs above, aspirin was held during the hospitalization given the \nrecent GI bleed.  Given the patient has significant \nnon-obstructive coronary artery disease, the patient should be \nrestarted on aspirin therapy in the future.  Encouraged the \npatient to discuss this with his primary care doctor on follow \nup.  As above, initially held propranolol, however restarted \nduring hospitalization.  The patient reported he was taking \npropranolol only once daily, we restarted on TID regimen and \ndischarged the patient home with this regimen.  We also continue \nthe patient's home statin regimen.  \n.  \n# PUMP: The patient has a EF reduced by recent intra-operative \nTEE during most recent aortic valve replacement.  The patient \nwas monitored for signs of congestive heart failure and volume \noverload.  The patient remained euvolemic during the \nhospitalization and did not require diuretic therapy.  We \ncontinued the propanolol as above.   \n.  \n# RHYTHM: The patient has a history of sinus tachycardia, \nhowever remained in normal sinus rhythm during hospitalization.  \nHe was monitored continuously on telemetry.  The patient was \ncontinued on propranolol as above.\n.  \n# Mechanical AVR:  The patient has a history of congenital \nbicuspid aortic valve, s/p three valve replacements.  Most \nrecent valve is a St. ___ valve.  The patient was therapeutic \nwith regards to his coumadin dosing on admission, however \ncoumadin held for GI bleed.  Heparin drip was initiated, then \ncoumadin added when procedures completed.  The patient was \ninitially loaded with coumadin at a dose of 10mg per day, thus \nwas bridged for one day while INR therapeutic on heparin drip \nprior to discontinuing the heparin.  The patient was discharged \non his home dose of coumadin 4mg every day with the instruction \nto follow up with his ___ clinic for frequent checks.  We \nmonitored his INR daily while inpatient.  Patient was \ntherapeutic for two days prior to discharge.\n.  \n# Abdominal lymphadenopathy:  Patient had known abdominal \nlymphadenopathy in the setting of traumatic splenectomy.  The \npatient has been followed by Dr. ___ the lymphadenopathy. \n During his hospitalization a CT Abd Pelvis was completed for \nevaluation of flank pain and to monitor progression of \nlymphadenopathy.  A renal mass was noted on the CT scan.  \nUrology, Dr. ___, was consulted for further evaluation of \npossible urothelial malignancy.  While the patient was off \ncoumadin, a cystoscopy was performed.  The mass noted on CT scan \nwas noted on cystoscopy to be a prominent papilla of the renal \nparenchyma.  There was no evidence of urothelial malignancy on \nthe cystoscopy or by cytology of the bladder washings.  The \npatient did experience hematuria following the cystoscopy.  This \nwas as suspected as the patient although was not on coumadin, \nwas on heparin drip at the time of the procedure.  The patient \nhad no symptoms of dysuria, urgency, hesitancy or failure to \ncomplete voiding during the time of hematuria.  The patient was \ninstructed to follow up with Dr. ___ week of discharge.  \n\n.\n# Depression: Stable on admission.  Continued home regimen of \nlexapro throughout hospital course.  \n.  \n# EtOH abuse: Per patient's history, however alcohol level on \nadmission was zero.  We monitored the patient for signs of \nwithdrawal and maintained the patient on a CIWA scale, given his \nhistory of post-op delirium, however the patient did not require \nthe use of any benzodiazepines.  The patient was started on \nthiamine and folic acid on admission. This regimen was continued \nthroughout the hospitalization.\n.  \nFEN: The patient was maintained on a heart healthy, regular \ndiet.  Repleted electrolytes as needed.\n.  \nACCESS: two large bore peripheral IV's\n.  \nPROPHYLAXIS:  initially therapeutic on coumadin, then heparin \ndrip.\n.  \nCODE STATUS:  FULL\n.  \nCONTACT: Patient, daughter ___ ___  \n \n___ on Admission:\nAtorvastatin 40 mg  \nLexapro 20 mg  \npropanolol 10mg daily  \nranitidine 150 mg  \ncoumadin 4mg hs  \naspirin 81 mg  \niron sulfate 325  \nfolate 1 mg  \nmultivitamin\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

As discussed further below, the patient should \nhave a discussion with his primary care physician as to when to \nrestart aspirin therapy.  Propranolol was also held initially \ngiven the GI bleed, but restarted at home dose prior to \ndischarge.  \n.\n# Right-rib and abdominal pain s/p traumatic injury of fall:  We \nhad a low level of concern for intra-abdominal/subcapsular liver \ninjury with fall in setting of clinical appearance.  The \npatient's liver function tests were only mildly elevated and the \nhistory of alcohol use was definitely considered as the \netiology.  CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis did not show \nany sign of concerning retroperitoneal process, see discussion \nof CT findings below.  Pain most likely result of \nmusculoskeletal discomfort.  Pain resolved with tylenol only.  \nPatient asymptomatic prior to discharge. \n.  \n# CORONARIES:  Recent cardiac cath in ___ showed left dominant \nsystem revealed \nnonobstructive coronary disease, with no disease in the ___, \nminimal disease in the LAD, the LCX was dominant and had a long \n50% OM1 lesion and LPDA with minimal disease and the RCA with \ndiffuse disease.  No active ischemia evident on admission or \nduring hospitalization.  One set of cardiac enzymes negative.  \nAs above, aspirin was held during the hospitalization given the \nrecent GI bleed.  Given the patient has significant \nnon-obstructive coronary artery disease, the patient should be \nrestarted on aspirin therapy in the future.  Encouraged the \npatient to discuss this with his primary care doctor on follow \nup.  As above, initially held propranolol, however restarted \nduring hospitalization.

Colonoscopy showed no abnormalities.  GI was \nconsulted during the admission.  They recommended H pylori \ntesting, which was negative, and capsule endoscopy to be \ncompleted as an outpatient for complete work up of GI bleed.  \nPatient instructed to schedule capsule endoscopy as outpatient.  \nPatient was continued on twice a day IV pantoprazole while \ninpatient and switched to oral regimen prior to discharge.   \nActive type and screen completed as well as two large bore iv's \nplaced on admission.  Trended patient's hematocrit daily.  \nBaseline Hct was difficult to determine as has fluctuated \ndramatically during previous hospitalizations, however remained \nstable through this hospitalization.  Iron studies, B12 and \nfolate all within normal limits.

Colonoscopy showed no abnormalities.  GI was \nconsulted during the admission.  They recommended H pylori \ntesting, which was negative, and capsule endoscopy to be \ncompleted as an outpatient for complete work up of GI bleed.  \nPatient instructed to schedule capsule endoscopy as outpatient.  \nPatient was continued on twice a day IV pantoprazole while \ninpatient and switched to oral regimen prior to discharge.   \nActive type and screen completed as well as two large bore iv's \nplaced on admission.  Trended patient's hematocrit daily.  \nBaseline Hct was difficult to determine as has fluctuated \ndramatically during previous hospitalizations, however remained \nstable through this hospitalization.  Iron studies, B12 and \nfolate all within normal limits.  The patient was on iron \ntherapy prior to admission, held per GI for colonoscopy ease.  \nThe patient was restarted on iron prior to discharge.  \nHaptoglobin was found to be less than 20 on three separate \noccasions.  This finding points towards hemolysis of unclear \netiology, however unknown significance in the setting of \nsplenectomy.  The patient was restarted on heparin drip \ninitially then coumadin when patient no longer reported melena \nor hematochezia.  We held the patient's aspirin during the \nhospitalization.  As discussed further below, the patient should \nhave a discussion with his primary care physician as to when to \nrestart aspirin therapy.  Propranolol was also held initially \ngiven the GI bleed, but restarted at home dose prior to \ndischarge.  \n.\n# Right-rib and abdominal pain s/p traumatic injury of fall:  We \nhad a low level of concern for intra-abdominal/subcapsular liver \ninjury with fall in setting of clinical appearance.  The \npatient's liver function tests were only mildly elevated and the \nhistory of alcohol use was definitely considered as the \netiology.  CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis did not show \nany sign of concerning retroperitoneal process, see discussion \nof CT findings below.  Pain most likely result of \nmusculoskeletal discomfort.  Pain resolved with tylenol only.  \nPatient asymptomatic prior to discharge. \n.  \n# CORONARIES:  Recent cardiac cath in ___ showed left dominant \nsystem revealed \nnonobstructive coronary disease, with no disease in the ___, \nminimal disease in the LAD, the LCX was dominant and had a long \n50% OM1 lesion and LPDA with minimal disease and the RCA with \ndiffuse disease.  No active ischemia evident on admission or \nduring hospitalization.  One set of cardiac enzymes negative.  \nAs above, aspirin was held during the hospitalization given the \nrecent GI bleed.  Given the patient has significant \nnon-obstructive coronary artery disease, the patient should be \nrestarted on aspirin therapy in the future.  Encouraged the \npatient to discuss this with his primary care doctor on follow \nup.  As above, initially held propranolol, however restarted \nduring hospitalization.  The patient reported he was taking \npropranolol only once daily, we restarted on TID regimen and \ndischarged the patient home with this regimen.  We also continue \nthe patient's home statin regimen.  \n.  \n# PUMP: The patient has a EF reduced by recent intra-operative \nTEE during most recent aortic valve replacement.  The patient \nwas monitored for signs of congestive heart failure and volume \noverload.  The patient remained euvolemic during the \nhospitalization and did not require diuretic therapy.  We \ncontinued the propanolol as above.   \n.  \n# RHYTHM: The patient has a history of sinus tachycardia, \nhowever remained in normal sinus rhythm during hospitalization.  \nHe was monitored continuously on telemetry.  The patient was \ncontinued on propranolol as above.\n.  \n# Mechanical AVR:  The patient has a history of congenital \nbicuspid aortic valve, s/p three valve replacements.  Most \nrecent valve is a St. ___ valve.  The patient was therapeutic \nwith regards to his coumadin dosing on admission, however \ncoumadin held for GI bleed.  Heparin drip was initiated, then \ncoumadin added when procedures completed.  The patient was \ninitially loaded with coumadin at a dose of 10mg per day, thus \nwas bridged for one day while INR therapeutic on heparin drip \nprior to discontinuing the heparin.  The patient was discharged \non his home dose of coumadin 4mg every day with the instruction \nto follow up with his ___ clinic for frequent checks.  We \nmonitored his INR daily while inpatient.  Patient was \ntherapeutic for two days prior to discharge.\n.  \n# Abdominal lymphadenopathy:  Patient had known abdominal \nlymphadenopathy in the setting of traumatic splenectomy.  The \npatient has been followed by Dr. ___ the lymphadenopathy. \n During his hospitalization a CT Abd Pelvis was completed for \nevaluation of flank pain and to monitor progression of \nlymphadenopathy.  A renal mass was noted on the CT scan.  \nUrology, Dr. ___, was consulted for further evaluation of \npossible urothelial malignancy.  While the patient was off \ncoumadin, a cystoscopy was performed.  The mass noted on CT scan \nwas noted on cystoscopy to be a prominent papilla of the renal \nparenchyma.  There was no evidence of urothelial malignancy on \nthe cystoscopy or by cytology of the bladder washings.  The \npatient did experience hematuria following the cystoscopy.  This \nwas as suspected as the patient although was not on coumadin, \nwas on heparin drip at the time of the procedure.  The patient \nhad no symptoms of dysuria, urgency, hesitancy or failure to \ncomplete voiding during the time of hematuria.  The patient was \ninstructed to follow up with Dr. ___ week of discharge.  \n\n.\n# Depression: Stable on admission.  Continued home regimen of \nlexapro throughout hospital course.  \n.  \n# EtOH abuse: Per patient's history, however alcohol level on \nadmission was zero.  We monitored the patient for signs of \nwithdrawal and maintained the patient on a CIWA scale, given his \nhistory of post-op delirium, however the patient did not require \nthe use of any benzodiazepines.  The patient was started on \nthiamine and folic acid on admission. This regimen was continued \nthroughout the hospitalization.\n.  \nFEN: The patient was maintained on a heart healthy, regular \ndiet.  Repleted electrolytes as needed.\n.  \nACCESS: two large bore peripheral IV's\n.  \nPROPHYLAXIS:  initially therapeutic on coumadin, then heparin \ndrip.\n.  \nCODE STATUS:  FULL\n.  \nCONTACT: Patient, daughter ___ ___  \n \n___ on Admission:\nAtorvastatin 40 mg  \nLexapro 20 mg  \npropanolol 10mg daily  \nranitidine 150 mg  \ncoumadin 4mg hs  \naspirin 81 mg  \niron sulfate 325  \nfolate 1 mg  \nmultivitamin\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Heparin drip was \ndiscontinued and IVC filter was placed at OSH prior to patient \nbeing transferred to ___ for neurosurgical evaluation. On \nadmission patient was admitted to the ___ for close \nneurological monitoring with the following hospital course \nbelow.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES ADDRESSED\n=======================\n#Concern for epidural hemorrhage\nWhen patient arrived to the ICU she reported her BLE \nstrength/motor was stable to when she left ___ on ___ or \npossibly improved. A second opinion ___ was obtained on the OSH \nMRI L spine which showed the fluid collection was likely \nconsistent with a postsurgical seroma. No hematoma present. She \nwas restarted on heparin gtt for saddle PE and DVTs. \n\n#Saddle PE\nBilateral DVTs\nPatient was admitted to the ICU satting 94-95% on RA. VSS. Based \non second opinion ___ of her MRI L spine at the OSH there was \nno concern for hemorrhage and she was restarted on her heparin \ngtt for Saddle PE and DVTs with goal PTT 50-70. MASCOT was \ncontacted who determined the patient was not a candidate for \ncatheter based thrombolysis given her clinical exam, and stable \nrespiratory picture. IVC filter was not removed. Heparin gtt was \ntitrated for a ptt goal of 60-80, goal was attained on ___. \nPatient was started on Coumadin on ___ with plan for bridge off \nof heparin gtt. INRs were checked daily for a goal INR of ___. \nPatient was transitioned from her heparin gtt to Coumadin on \n___. On ___, her Coumadin was held for a supratherapeutic INR \nof 3.5. During morning rounds, it was noted that her left leg \nwas significantly swollen and the patient was complaining of \npain. An ultrasound was completed which demonstrated that there \nwas no flow of the deep veins in the left leg. Vascular surgery \nwas reconsulted; they wrapped her leg and pulse checks were \ninitiated. A hematology/oncology consult was ordered and labs to \nrule out HIT were sent. Hematology recommended reversing the \nCoumadin since it is possible the patient is non-responsive and \nto start her on therapeutic Lovenox. CTA abdomen, pelvis, and \nlower extremities showed extension of DVT to level of common \nilliacs with partial occlusion to total occlusion of LLE. The \npatient's lovenox was titrated for therapeutic level of 0.86 at \n4 hrs post-administration of lovenox ___ mg SC Q12H. Patient to \nf/u with vascular medicine after discharge. Patient to obtain \ncompression stockings for b/l leg swelling as outpatient to \nincrease compression and blood return to lower extremities.\n\n#Orthostatic hypotension: Likely ___ prolonged immobility over \nthe\nlast few weeks, also poor cardiac reserve in the setting of \nlarge\nclot burden. She has been persistently tachycardic, which is\nexpected for her RV function and clot burden. TTE on ___ showed \nnormal RV function and size. AM cortisol negative for adrenal \ninsufficiency. Her orthostatic hypotension improved and on day \nof d/c was negative for drop in BP and she was asymptomatic when \nstanding and walking with physical therapy team.\n\n#Elevated transaminases: Patient with increased AST, ALT, \nalkaline phosphatase on ___ from stable prior ___. No liver \nhistory. Transaminases were mildly elevated on arrival with peak \nof 5x ULN (AST 158, ALT 300) suggesting exacerbation of a \npre-existing liver condition. Physical exam and CT with contrast \nare unremarkable for any evidence of chronic liver disease (and \ndo not suggest Budd-Chiari). TTE did not show evidence of R \nheart failure from the PE, so it is not congestive hepatopathy. \nHepatitis labs and autoimmune lab w/u was thus far negative. \nLFTs were downtrending on d/c. We would recommend outpatient w/u \nof issue as transitional issue.\n\n# Urinary retention: Patient has had persistent urinary \nretention since her operation, has been persistent and stable \nfor over 2 weeks. She received intermittent straight cath Q6hr.\n\n#Constipation (resolved): Constipated while in house without \ntaking\nopioids. Likely ___ immobility and also has urinary retention \nafter\nsurgery. Air fluid level with colonic ileus on KUB which \nresolved with large BM after aggressive bowel regimen. Would \nrecommend regular bowel regimen with decreased mobility. \n\n#UTI: Patient was found to have UTI at the OSH and was started \non ceftriaxone. Antibiotic course was completed on ___. \n\n# Fever (resolved) \nThe patient spiked fever to 101.3 on ___ with mild \nleukocytosis.\nUnclear etiology. Pt has been afebrile since. Infectious w/u \n(including Ua/UCx, CXR, blood cultures) was negative.\n\n#Cauda ___ s/p L4-5 laminectomy: Patient with acute \nrehabilitation needs and was evaluated by ___. Rehabilitation \ncomplicated by orthostatic hypotension as described above. MRI \nlumbar spine - second opinion ___ no hematoma, stable post-op \nchanges.

Heparin drip was \ndiscontinued and IVC filter was placed at OSH prior to patient \nbeing transferred to ___ for neurosurgical evaluation. On \nadmission patient was admitted to the ___ for close \nneurological monitoring with the following hospital course \nbelow.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES ADDRESSED\n=======================\n#Concern for epidural hemorrhage\nWhen patient arrived to the ICU she reported her BLE \nstrength/motor was stable to when she left ___ on ___ or \npossibly improved. A second opinion ___ was obtained on the OSH \nMRI L spine which showed the fluid collection was likely \nconsistent with a postsurgical seroma. No hematoma present. She \nwas restarted on heparin gtt for saddle PE and DVTs. \n\n#Saddle PE\nBilateral DVTs\nPatient was admitted to the ICU satting 94-95% on RA. VSS. Based \non second opinion ___ of her MRI L spine at the OSH there was \nno concern for hemorrhage and she was restarted on her heparin \ngtt for Saddle PE and DVTs with goal PTT 50-70. MASCOT was \ncontacted who determined the patient was not a candidate for \ncatheter based thrombolysis given her clinical exam, and stable \nrespiratory picture. IVC filter was not removed. Heparin gtt was \ntitrated for a ptt goal of 60-80, goal was attained on ___. \nPatient was started on Coumadin on ___ with plan for bridge off \nof heparin gtt. INRs were checked daily for a goal INR of ___. \nPatient was transitioned from her heparin gtt to Coumadin on \n___. On ___, her Coumadin was held for a supratherapeutic INR \nof 3.5. During morning rounds, it was noted that her left leg \nwas significantly swollen and the patient was complaining of \npain. An ultrasound was completed which demonstrated that there \nwas no flow of the deep veins in the left leg. Vascular surgery \nwas reconsulted; they wrapped her leg and pulse checks were \ninitiated. A hematology/oncology consult was ordered and labs to \nrule out HIT were sent. Hematology recommended reversing the \nCoumadin since it is possible the patient is non-responsive and \nto start her on therapeutic Lovenox. CTA abdomen, pelvis, and \nlower extremities showed extension of DVT to level of common \nilliacs with partial occlusion to total occlusion of LLE. The \npatient's lovenox was titrated for therapeutic level of 0.86 at \n4 hrs post-administration of lovenox ___ mg SC Q12H. Patient to \nf/u with vascular medicine after discharge. Patient to obtain \ncompression stockings for b/l leg swelling as outpatient to \nincrease compression and blood return to lower extremities.\n\n#Orthostatic hypotension: Likely ___ prolonged immobility over \nthe\nlast few weeks, also poor cardiac reserve in the setting of \nlarge\nclot burden. She has been persistently tachycardic, which is\nexpected for her RV function and clot burden. TTE on ___ showed \nnormal RV function and size. AM cortisol negative for adrenal \ninsufficiency. Her orthostatic hypotension improved and on day \nof d/c was negative for drop in BP and she was asymptomatic when \nstanding and walking with physical therapy team.\n\n#Elevated transaminases: Patient with increased AST, ALT, \nalkaline phosphatase on ___ from stable prior ___. No liver \nhistory. Transaminases were mildly elevated on arrival with peak \nof 5x ULN (AST 158, ALT 300) suggesting exacerbation of a \npre-existing liver condition. Physical exam and CT with contrast \nare unremarkable for any evidence of chronic liver disease (and \ndo not suggest Budd-Chiari). TTE did not show evidence of R \nheart failure from the PE, so it is not congestive hepatopathy. \nHepatitis labs and autoimmune lab w/u was thus far negative. \nLFTs were downtrending on d/c. We would recommend outpatient w/u \nof issue as transitional issue.\n\n# Urinary retention: Patient has had persistent urinary \nretention since her operation, has been persistent and stable \nfor over 2 weeks. She received intermittent straight cath Q6hr.\n\n#Constipation (resolved): Constipated while in house without \ntaking\nopioids. Likely ___ immobility and also has urinary retention \nafter\nsurgery. Air fluid level with colonic ileus on KUB which \nresolved with large BM after aggressive bowel regimen. Would \nrecommend regular bowel regimen with decreased mobility. \n\n#UTI: Patient was found to have UTI at the OSH and was started \non ceftriaxone. Antibiotic course was completed on ___. \n\n# Fever (resolved) \nThe patient spiked fever to 101.3 on ___ with mild \nleukocytosis.\nUnclear etiology. Pt has been afebrile since. Infectious w/u \n(including Ua/UCx, CXR, blood cultures) was negative.\n\n#Cauda ___ s/p L4-5 laminectomy: Patient with acute \nrehabilitation needs and was evaluated by ___. Rehabilitation \ncomplicated by orthostatic hypotension as described above. MRI \nlumbar spine - second opinion ___ no hematoma, stable post-op \nchanges. Pain was well-controlled with Tylenol.\n\nTransitional Issues\n====================\n[] Patient being discharged to acute rehab at ___\n[] PE/DVTs: patient d/c'd on ___ SC for anticoagulation \n [] F/u with vascular medicine clinic at ___ as scheduled\n [] F/u with ___ clinic at ___ as scheduled\n[] Elevated transaminases: repeat LFTs within 1 week of \ndischarge.

Heparin drip was \ndiscontinued and IVC filter was placed at OSH prior to patient \nbeing transferred to ___ for neurosurgical evaluation. On \nadmission patient was admitted to the ___ for close \nneurological monitoring with the following hospital course \nbelow.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES ADDRESSED\n=======================\n#Concern for epidural hemorrhage\nWhen patient arrived to the ICU she reported her BLE \nstrength/motor was stable to when she left ___ on ___ or \npossibly improved. A second opinion ___ was obtained on the OSH \nMRI L spine which showed the fluid collection was likely \nconsistent with a postsurgical seroma. No hematoma present. She \nwas restarted on heparin gtt for saddle PE and DVTs. \n\n#Saddle PE\nBilateral DVTs\nPatient was admitted to the ICU satting 94-95% on RA. VSS. Based \non second opinion ___ of her MRI L spine at the OSH there was \nno concern for hemorrhage and she was restarted on her heparin \ngtt for Saddle PE and DVTs with goal PTT 50-70. MASCOT was \ncontacted who determined the patient was not a candidate for \ncatheter based thrombolysis given her clinical exam, and stable \nrespiratory picture. IVC filter was not removed. Heparin gtt was \ntitrated for a ptt goal of 60-80, goal was attained on ___. \nPatient was started on Coumadin on ___ with plan for bridge off \nof heparin gtt. INRs were checked daily for a goal INR of ___. \nPatient was transitioned from her heparin gtt to Coumadin on \n___. On ___, her Coumadin was held for a supratherapeutic INR \nof 3.5. During morning rounds, it was noted that her left leg \nwas significantly swollen and the patient was complaining of \npain. An ultrasound was completed which demonstrated that there \nwas no flow of the deep veins in the left leg. Vascular surgery \nwas reconsulted; they wrapped her leg and pulse checks were \ninitiated. A hematology/oncology consult was ordered and labs to \nrule out HIT were sent. Hematology recommended reversing the \nCoumadin since it is possible the patient is non-responsive and \nto start her on therapeutic Lovenox. CTA abdomen, pelvis, and \nlower extremities showed extension of DVT to level of common \nilliacs with partial occlusion to total occlusion of LLE. The \npatient's lovenox was titrated for therapeutic level of 0.86 at \n4 hrs post-administration of lovenox ___ mg SC Q12H. Patient to \nf/u with vascular medicine after discharge. Patient to obtain \ncompression stockings for b/l leg swelling as outpatient to \nincrease compression and blood return to lower extremities.\n\n#Orthostatic hypotension: Likely ___ prolonged immobility over \nthe\nlast few weeks, also poor cardiac reserve in the setting of \nlarge\nclot burden. She has been persistently tachycardic, which is\nexpected for her RV function and clot burden. TTE on ___ showed \nnormal RV function and size. AM cortisol negative for adrenal \ninsufficiency. Her orthostatic hypotension improved and on day \nof d/c was negative for drop in BP and she was asymptomatic when \nstanding and walking with physical therapy team.\n\n#Elevated transaminases: Patient with increased AST, ALT, \nalkaline phosphatase on ___ from stable prior ___. No liver \nhistory. Transaminases were mildly elevated on arrival with peak \nof 5x ULN (AST 158, ALT 300) suggesting exacerbation of a \npre-existing liver condition. Physical exam and CT with contrast \nare unremarkable for any evidence of chronic liver disease (and \ndo not suggest Budd-Chiari). TTE did not show evidence of R \nheart failure from the PE, so it is not congestive hepatopathy. \nHepatitis labs and autoimmune lab w/u was thus far negative. \nLFTs were downtrending on d/c. We would recommend outpatient w/u \nof issue as transitional issue.\n\n# Urinary retention: Patient has had persistent urinary \nretention since her operation, has been persistent and stable \nfor over 2 weeks. She received intermittent straight cath Q6hr.\n\n#Constipation (resolved): Constipated while in house without \ntaking\nopioids. Likely ___ immobility and also has urinary retention \nafter\nsurgery. Air fluid level with colonic ileus on KUB which \nresolved with large BM after aggressive bowel regimen. Would \nrecommend regular bowel regimen with decreased mobility. \n\n#UTI: Patient was found to have UTI at the OSH and was started \non ceftriaxone. Antibiotic course was completed on ___. \n\n# Fever (resolved) \nThe patient spiked fever to 101.3 on ___ with mild \nleukocytosis.\nUnclear etiology. Pt has been afebrile since. Infectious w/u \n(including Ua/UCx, CXR, blood cultures) was negative.\n\n#Cauda ___ s/p L4-5 laminectomy: Patient with acute \nrehabilitation needs and was evaluated by ___. Rehabilitation \ncomplicated by orthostatic hypotension as described above. MRI \nlumbar spine - second opinion ___ no hematoma, stable post-op \nchanges. Pain was well-controlled with Tylenol.\n\nTransitional Issues\n====================\n[] Patient being discharged to acute rehab at ___\n[] PE/DVTs: patient d/c'd on ___ SC for anticoagulation \n [] F/u with vascular medicine clinic at ___ as scheduled\n [] F/u with ___ clinic at ___ as scheduled\n[] Elevated transaminases: repeat LFTs within 1 week of \ndischarge.

No evidence of \nosteomyelitis. \n.\nRLE US ___:\nFINDINGS: \nIn the skin overlying the right hip, there is a large \nsuperficial skin \nulceration with purulent material draining from it.  \nJust deep to this ulcer, there is a large fluid collection that \nappears \ndensely packed with echogenic mobile debris.  Its margins are \ndifficult to delineate with the ultrasound probe that is \navailable.  At the periphery of this fluid collection there is \nan anechoic fluid collection, which may correspond to the bursa. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \nThe findings are most compatible with an abscess deep to a skin \nulcer in the right buttock region.  The extent of this fluid \ncollection should be better characterized with cross sectional \nimaging, after which, aspiration can be performed.   \n.\nCT-GUIDED ABSCESS DRAINAGE ___:\nCT FINDINGS: \nPatient is known with a large superficial skin ulceration \noverlying the right hip.  Underneath this ulceration there are \ntwo linear collections \ncommunicating between them and going to that ulcer; the more \nsuperficial one contains a fat-fluid level and measures 11.5 x \n2.4 cm; the deepest one measures 13 x 2.4 cm, the collection is \nin the subcutaneous fat and goes up to the gluteus muscle.  \nThere is also a small collection in the anterior portion of the \nright maximus gluteus muscle (series 3, image 38) measuring 17 x \n27 mm. The greater trochanter lies just beneath the collection.  \nThere is minimal irregularity of the cortex but which is similar \nto the other side.  There is no significant sign of \nosteomyelitis. \nThere is significant degenerative change of the spine with \nanterolisthesis of L4 over L5 measuring 7 mm. \nMultiple gallstones are seen without sign of cholecystitis.  \nSmall and large bowel of the pelvis are unremarkable.  A Foley \ncatheter is in the bladder. The uterus is unremarkable.  There \nis a rectal and uterine prolapse. \nPROCEDURE: \nIt was decided to aspirate and drain the more superficial \ncollection which should be in continuity with the deepest one. \nThe procedure risks and benefits and alternatives were discussed \nwith the \npatient and written informed consent was obtained.  A \npreprocedure timeout was performed, discussing the planned \nprocedure, confirming the patient's identity with three \nidentifiers and reviewing a checklist per ___ protocol. \nThe patient was placed on left lateral decubitus on the CT table \nto access the subcutaneous right hip collection.  Under CT \nguidance, an entrance site was selected and the skin was prepped \nand draped in the usual sterile fashion.  5 cc of lidocaine 1% \nwas instilled for local anesthesia.  A 5 ___ ___ catheter \nneedle was first inserted into the collection where 30 cc of pus \nwas removed and sent to microbiology.  Then by a more anterior \napproach with an 18 gauge ___ needle, ___ wire was put \ninto the collection and 6 ___ catheter was then inserted. \nDeep sedation was provided by the anesthesia, please refer to \ntheir note for further detail.  There was no complication after \nthe procedure. \nIMPRESSION: \nCT-guided placement of a 6 ___ catheter inside the soft \ntissue abcess \noverlyng the right hip.  Pus was removed from the collection and \nsent to \nmicrobiology. \n.\nPATHOLOGY OF NECROTIC R HIP TISSUE ___: Skin with ulceration \nand gangrenous necrosis of dermal and subcutaneous soft tissues.\n.\nCXR ___:\nNew right subclavian line ends in the mid SVC.

This is grossly unchanged when compared to the prior \nstudy.  No additional fluid collections are identified.  \nUnderlying bone is unremarkable. \nIMPRESSION:  Grossly stable mild-to-moderate amount of fluid in \nthe right \ngreater trochanteric bursa, representing bursitis. \n.\nMRI PELVIS ___:\nFINDINGS: \nThe single provided axial T1-weighted sequence demonstrates no \ngross evidence of abnormal marrow edema within the pelvis.  \nThere is diffuse muscular atrophy.  There is skin thickening \nagain noted posterior to the coccyx similar to the prior CT \nexamination.  There is no evidence of a collection adjacent to \nthe coccyx however.  \nThere has been interval increase in size of a partially imaged \ncrescentic T1 hypointense subcutaneous right gluteal collection \nmeasuring approximately 6.0 cm TRV x 4.4 cm AP which previously \nmeasured approximately 5.3 cm TRV x 3.6 cm AP. \nIMPRESSION: \n1.  No gross evidence of osteomyelitis on this suboptimal MR \nexamination of the pelvis. \n2.  Interval increase in size of a partially imaged right \ngluteal subcutaneous fluid collection since ___.  \nFollowup MR examination of the pelvis with sedation and / or CT \nexamination would provide further imaging evaluation if \nclinically warranted. \n.\nCXR ___:\nHeart and mediastinum are normal.  The lung fields are clear.  \nNo evidence of pneumonia is present.  Chest clear. \n.\nKNEE XR ___:\nRIGHT KNEE:  Degenerative changes are seen in all areas of the \nknee with \nosteophyte formation and narrowing of the joint space.  No \nsignificant \neffusions are present on this side. \nLEFT KNEE: AP views of the left knee is somewhat limited.  \nMarked degenerative changes with almost complete loss of the \njoint space are present in the medial compartment and marked \nnarrowing in the lateral compartment is also present. In all \nother areas degenerative changes are present.  No effusion is \nidentified.  No areas of erosion are seen. \nIMPRESSION:  Severe degenerative changes.  No evidence of \nosteomyelitis. \n.\nRLE US ___:\nFINDINGS: \nIn the skin overlying the right hip, there is a large \nsuperficial skin \nulceration with purulent material draining from it.  \nJust deep to this ulcer, there is a large fluid collection that \nappears \ndensely packed with echogenic mobile debris.  Its margins are \ndifficult to delineate with the ultrasound probe that is \navailable.  At the periphery of this fluid collection there is \nan anechoic fluid collection, which may correspond to the bursa. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \nThe findings are most compatible with an abscess deep to a skin \nulcer in the right buttock region.  The extent of this fluid \ncollection should be better characterized with cross sectional \nimaging, after which, aspiration can be performed.   \n.\nCT-GUIDED ABSCESS DRAINAGE ___:\nCT FINDINGS: \nPatient is known with a large superficial skin ulceration \noverlying the right hip.  Underneath this ulceration there are \ntwo linear collections \ncommunicating between them and going to that ulcer; the more \nsuperficial one contains a fat-fluid level and measures 11.5 x \n2.4 cm; the deepest one measures 13 x 2.4 cm, the collection is \nin the subcutaneous fat and goes up to the gluteus muscle.  \nThere is also a small collection in the anterior portion of the \nright maximus gluteus muscle (series 3, image 38) measuring 17 x \n27 mm. The greater trochanter lies just beneath the collection.  \nThere is minimal irregularity of the cortex but which is similar \nto the other side.  There is no significant sign of \nosteomyelitis. \nThere is significant degenerative change of the spine with \nanterolisthesis of L4 over L5 measuring 7 mm. \nMultiple gallstones are seen without sign of cholecystitis.  \nSmall and large bowel of the pelvis are unremarkable.  A Foley \ncatheter is in the bladder. The uterus is unremarkable.  There \nis a rectal and uterine prolapse. \nPROCEDURE: \nIt was decided to aspirate and drain the more superficial \ncollection which should be in continuity with the deepest one. \nThe procedure risks and benefits and alternatives were discussed \nwith the \npatient and written informed consent was obtained.  A \npreprocedure timeout was performed, discussing the planned \nprocedure, confirming the patient's identity with three \nidentifiers and reviewing a checklist per ___ protocol. \nThe patient was placed on left lateral decubitus on the CT table \nto access the subcutaneous right hip collection.  Under CT \nguidance, an entrance site was selected and the skin was prepped \nand draped in the usual sterile fashion.  5 cc of lidocaine 1% \nwas instilled for local anesthesia.  A 5 ___ ___ catheter \nneedle was first inserted into the collection where 30 cc of pus \nwas removed and sent to microbiology.

No evidence of \nosteomyelitis. \n.\nRLE US ___:\nFINDINGS: \nIn the skin overlying the right hip, there is a large \nsuperficial skin \nulceration with purulent material draining from it.  \nJust deep to this ulcer, there is a large fluid collection that \nappears \ndensely packed with echogenic mobile debris.  Its margins are \ndifficult to delineate with the ultrasound probe that is \navailable.  At the periphery of this fluid collection there is \nan anechoic fluid collection, which may correspond to the bursa. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \nThe findings are most compatible with an abscess deep to a skin \nulcer in the right buttock region.  The extent of this fluid \ncollection should be better characterized with cross sectional \nimaging, after which, aspiration can be performed.   \n.\nCT-GUIDED ABSCESS DRAINAGE ___:\nCT FINDINGS: \nPatient is known with a large superficial skin ulceration \noverlying the right hip.  Underneath this ulceration there are \ntwo linear collections \ncommunicating between them and going to that ulcer; the more \nsuperficial one contains a fat-fluid level and measures 11.5 x \n2.4 cm; the deepest one measures 13 x 2.4 cm, the collection is \nin the subcutaneous fat and goes up to the gluteus muscle.  \nThere is also a small collection in the anterior portion of the \nright maximus gluteus muscle (series 3, image 38) measuring 17 x \n27 mm. The greater trochanter lies just beneath the collection.  \nThere is minimal irregularity of the cortex but which is similar \nto the other side.  There is no significant sign of \nosteomyelitis. \nThere is significant degenerative change of the spine with \nanterolisthesis of L4 over L5 measuring 7 mm. \nMultiple gallstones are seen without sign of cholecystitis.  \nSmall and large bowel of the pelvis are unremarkable.  A Foley \ncatheter is in the bladder. The uterus is unremarkable.  There \nis a rectal and uterine prolapse. \nPROCEDURE: \nIt was decided to aspirate and drain the more superficial \ncollection which should be in continuity with the deepest one. \nThe procedure risks and benefits and alternatives were discussed \nwith the \npatient and written informed consent was obtained.  A \npreprocedure timeout was performed, discussing the planned \nprocedure, confirming the patient's identity with three \nidentifiers and reviewing a checklist per ___ protocol. \nThe patient was placed on left lateral decubitus on the CT table \nto access the subcutaneous right hip collection.  Under CT \nguidance, an entrance site was selected and the skin was prepped \nand draped in the usual sterile fashion.  5 cc of lidocaine 1% \nwas instilled for local anesthesia.  A 5 ___ ___ catheter \nneedle was first inserted into the collection where 30 cc of pus \nwas removed and sent to microbiology.  Then by a more anterior \napproach with an 18 gauge ___ needle, ___ wire was put \ninto the collection and 6 ___ catheter was then inserted. \nDeep sedation was provided by the anesthesia, please refer to \ntheir note for further detail.  There was no complication after \nthe procedure. \nIMPRESSION: \nCT-guided placement of a 6 ___ catheter inside the soft \ntissue abcess \noverlyng the right hip.

This is grossly unchanged when compared to the prior \nstudy.  No additional fluid collections are identified.  \nUnderlying bone is unremarkable. \nIMPRESSION:  Grossly stable mild-to-moderate amount of fluid in \nthe right \ngreater trochanteric bursa, representing bursitis. \n.\nMRI PELVIS ___:\nFINDINGS: \nThe single provided axial T1-weighted sequence demonstrates no \ngross evidence of abnormal marrow edema within the pelvis.  \nThere is diffuse muscular atrophy.  There is skin thickening \nagain noted posterior to the coccyx similar to the prior CT \nexamination.  There is no evidence of a collection adjacent to \nthe coccyx however.  \nThere has been interval increase in size of a partially imaged \ncrescentic T1 hypointense subcutaneous right gluteal collection \nmeasuring approximately 6.0 cm TRV x 4.4 cm AP which previously \nmeasured approximately 5.3 cm TRV x 3.6 cm AP. \nIMPRESSION: \n1.  No gross evidence of osteomyelitis on this suboptimal MR \nexamination of the pelvis. \n2.  Interval increase in size of a partially imaged right \ngluteal subcutaneous fluid collection since ___.  \nFollowup MR examination of the pelvis with sedation and / or CT \nexamination would provide further imaging evaluation if \nclinically warranted. \n.\nCXR ___:\nHeart and mediastinum are normal.  The lung fields are clear.  \nNo evidence of pneumonia is present.  Chest clear. \n.\nKNEE XR ___:\nRIGHT KNEE:  Degenerative changes are seen in all areas of the \nknee with \nosteophyte formation and narrowing of the joint space.  No \nsignificant \neffusions are present on this side. \nLEFT KNEE: AP views of the left knee is somewhat limited.  \nMarked degenerative changes with almost complete loss of the \njoint space are present in the medial compartment and marked \nnarrowing in the lateral compartment is also present. In all \nother areas degenerative changes are present.  No effusion is \nidentified.  No areas of erosion are seen. \nIMPRESSION:  Severe degenerative changes.  No evidence of \nosteomyelitis. \n.\nRLE US ___:\nFINDINGS: \nIn the skin overlying the right hip, there is a large \nsuperficial skin \nulceration with purulent material draining from it.  \nJust deep to this ulcer, there is a large fluid collection that \nappears \ndensely packed with echogenic mobile debris.  Its margins are \ndifficult to delineate with the ultrasound probe that is \navailable.  At the periphery of this fluid collection there is \nan anechoic fluid collection, which may correspond to the bursa. \n  \nIMPRESSION: \nThe findings are most compatible with an abscess deep to a skin \nulcer in the right buttock region.  The extent of this fluid \ncollection should be better characterized with cross sectional \nimaging, after which, aspiration can be performed.   \n.\nCT-GUIDED ABSCESS DRAINAGE ___:\nCT FINDINGS: \nPatient is known with a large superficial skin ulceration \noverlying the right hip.  Underneath this ulceration there are \ntwo linear collections \ncommunicating between them and going to that ulcer; the more \nsuperficial one contains a fat-fluid level and measures 11.5 x \n2.4 cm; the deepest one measures 13 x 2.4 cm, the collection is \nin the subcutaneous fat and goes up to the gluteus muscle.  \nThere is also a small collection in the anterior portion of the \nright maximus gluteus muscle (series 3, image 38) measuring 17 x \n27 mm. The greater trochanter lies just beneath the collection.  \nThere is minimal irregularity of the cortex but which is similar \nto the other side.  There is no significant sign of \nosteomyelitis. \nThere is significant degenerative change of the spine with \nanterolisthesis of L4 over L5 measuring 7 mm. \nMultiple gallstones are seen without sign of cholecystitis.  \nSmall and large bowel of the pelvis are unremarkable.  A Foley \ncatheter is in the bladder. The uterus is unremarkable.  There \nis a rectal and uterine prolapse. \nPROCEDURE: \nIt was decided to aspirate and drain the more superficial \ncollection which should be in continuity with the deepest one. \nThe procedure risks and benefits and alternatives were discussed \nwith the \npatient and written informed consent was obtained.  A \npreprocedure timeout was performed, discussing the planned \nprocedure, confirming the patient's identity with three \nidentifiers and reviewing a checklist per ___ protocol. \nThe patient was placed on left lateral decubitus on the CT table \nto access the subcutaneous right hip collection.  Under CT \nguidance, an entrance site was selected and the skin was prepped \nand draped in the usual sterile fashion.  5 cc of lidocaine 1% \nwas instilled for local anesthesia.  A 5 ___ ___ catheter \nneedle was first inserted into the collection where 30 cc of pus \nwas removed and sent to microbiology.  Then by a more anterior \napproach with an 18 gauge ___ needle, ___ wire was put \ninto the collection and 6 ___ catheter was then inserted. \nDeep sedation was provided by the anesthesia, please refer to \ntheir note for further detail.  There was no complication after \nthe procedure. \nIMPRESSION: \nCT-guided placement of a 6 ___ catheter inside the soft \ntissue abcess \noverlyng the right hip.  Pus was removed from the collection and \nsent to \nmicrobiology. \n.\nPATHOLOGY OF NECROTIC R HIP TISSUE ___: Skin with ulceration \nand gangrenous necrosis of dermal and subcutaneous soft tissues.\n.\nCXR ___:\nNew right subclavian line ends in the mid SVC.  No pneumothorax, \npleural \neffusion or mediastinal widening.  Mild leftward mediastinal \nshift \nunexplained, since both lungs are well expanded and clear and \nthere is no \npneumothorax or effusion on the right.  Heart size normal. The \nstudy and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist. \n.\nCXR ___:\nFINDINGS:  In comparison with study of ___, there is little \ninterval change. Specifically, there is no evidence of pneumonia \nfollowing central line removal. There are low lung volumes, but \nno evidence of acute pneumonia or vascular congestion. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is an ___ with a hx ___ body dementia, AF (not \non AC), T2DM, who presented with recurrent fevers and R hip \npain/swelling.

Patient was transferred to the CCU for monitoring \nafter pericardiocentesis (no tamponade physiology on echo, \nprocedure performed for diagnostic purposes), who subsequently \ndeveloped fever and hypotension requiring pressure support with \nphenylephrine. He ultimately opted for re-focus of medical \nmanagement to pain management and positioning therapy and was \ndischarged to a rehabilitation facility.\n.\nACTIVE ISSUES\n# GOALS OF CARE: After significant discussion with both his \nfamily and his medical providers the patient voiced his desire \nfor re-focus of his medical management to control of his pain, \nand focus on comfort. These discussions arose in the setting of \ninitiation of permanent dialysis and prolonged and profound \nphysical and emotional decompensation. The patient stated he \nunderstood that termination of dialysis would not be compatible \nwith life. The patient was transferred to a rehabilitation \nfacility for management of pain and positioning therapy.\n.\n# PERICARDIAL EFFUSION: Echo performed on admission demonstrated \nlarge circumferential pericardial effusion, no evidence of \ntamponade. Since the patient had been having transient episodes \nof hypotension during HD sessions, and in order to better \nclarify the etiology of the pericardial fluid, a \npericardiocentesis was performed. Per report, 260 cc of yellow \nserous fluid was removed. Two hours post-procedure the patient \nbecame hypotensive, initially responding to fluid boluses, then \nrequiring Neo for pressure support. He was pan-cultured and \nstarted on broad antibiotics- vancomycin, cefepime and \nmetronidazole. It was noted that his pericardial fluid changed \nin nature from serous to cloudy pink thick fluid. He then became \nfebrile, and received more volume resuscitation for likely \nseptic shock.  Studies were consistent with an exudative \neffusion and culture grew vancomycin resistant enterococcus. \nBroad spectrum antibiotics were discontinued and daptomycin was \nstarted. The source remained unclear, given nothing on imaging \nto support contiguous spread, and highly unlikely that the \nprocedure introduced the organism. Furthermore, blood and urine \ncultures were negative throughout his hospital stay. A TEE was \nnegative for evidence of valvular vegetations. Repeat imaging \nshowed the effusion was resolved and the pericardial drain was \nremoved. He was treated with a 5 day course of Daptomycin before \nantibiotics were discontinued on discharge following the wishes \nof the patient.\n.\n# HYPOTENSION: The patient was noted to be hypotensive on \nadmission, thought to be secondary to hypovolemia from poor PO \nintake. He also had a recent history of transient hypotension \nduring hemodialysis for which he was started on midodrine. \nEchocardiogram revealed an enlarged pericardial effusion \n(details above). Post-pericardiocentesis the patient was treated \nwith fluid resuscitation and broad antibiotics for presumed \nseptic shock. His blood pressure was supported with \nphenylephrine. A ___ test was negative for adrenal \ninsufficiency.  Additionally, albumin of 1.7 so likely has poor \nintravascular osmotic pressure. Given his history of recent \nmedically-managed cholecystitis, and known intra-abdominal fluid \ncollections, a CT torso was obtained to investigate potential \nsources of infection. His HD catheter was removed. Surgery was \nconsulted to investigate possible cholecystitis (details below), \nand ___ performed a drainage of an intraabdominal fluid \ncollection, a hematoma. Serial blood and urine cultures were \nnegative. His hypotension resolved, and he was weaned off \nphenylephrine prior to discharge. His midodrine was increased to \n5 TID. Medical management was discontinued as the patient \ndeclined further medical management.\n.  \n# SUSPECTED CHOLECYSTITIS: The patient had a recent history of \nmedically-managed cholecystitis. On admission he was initially \ntreated with broad spectrum antibiotics, which were then \nnarrowed to Levaquin. Given our clinical concern for sepsis, a \nRUQ ultrasound was obtained and demonstrated a sludge-filled \ngallbladder and a small, unchanged fluid collection. CT torso \ndemonstrated stranding, concerning for acute cholecystitis. \nSurgery was consulted and recommended HIDA scan given low \nsuspicion on physical exam. HIDA scan was positive and a \npercutaneous drain was attempted; however, the procedure was \ncomplicated by collapse of the gallbladder (inconsistent with \nacute cholecystitis) and development of a small hematoma. A \ndrain was placed in the abdominal fluid collection, which \nappeared to be an old hematoma. Microbiology was sent and was \nnegative for growth. The drain was removed.  \n.\n# ESRD on HD: The patient normally receives HD on ___. \nRenal was consulted. HD initially was on hold given new pressor \nrequirement and stable electrolytes. Given concern for sepsis, \nthe tunneled dialysis catheter was removed and replaced with a \ntemporary catheter. Once stable, the patient received CVVH with \nphenylephrine for pressure support. Culture of the catheter tip \nrevealed no growth. A permanent catheter was not placed as the \npatient declined further dialysis.\n.\n# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION with RAPID VENTRICULAR RESPONSE: Present \non admission. The patient spontaneously cardioverted and \nremained in sinus for the rest of his admission. The patient has \n___ S2 score of 3; however, given his history of \nintraabdominal hematomas, we elected to continue aspirin 325 for \nanticoagulation. Medical management was discontinued as the \npatient declined further medical management.\n.\n# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Presented with CP in setting of AF \nwith RVR, found to have ST changes and elevated troponin \nconsistent with demand ischemia. Enzymes were cycled and the \npatient ruled out for an acute myocardial infarction. We \ncontinued his aspirin and statin. Medical management was \ndiscontinued as the patient declined further medical management.\n.\n# ANEMIA: No evidence of acute bleeding. Likely secondary to \nchronic inflammation. Is on Aranesp as outpatient. Hct trended \ndown initially on admission and was stable around 20 at the time \nof discharge. He required a transfusion of 1 unit of pRBCs with \nappropriate response.\n.  \n# THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Relatively stable. Unclear etiology, \nreportedly has chronic ITP, and is status post splenectomy.  \n.\n# PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY: Continued on gabapentin 100 qhs. \nMedical management was discontinued as the patient declined \nfurther medical management.\n.\n# GASTROPARESIS: Continued on metoclopramide 5 mg PO QIDACHS. \nMedical management was discontinued as the patient declined \nfurther medical management.\n.\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n- ___ Management: Management of pain and optimization of \npositional comfort.\n- Pending Studies: Pericardial and Abdominal Fluid Cytology, \nfinalized culture data\n- Code Status: DNR/DNI, do not resuscitate.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nacetaminophen 325 mg Tablet PO Q6H PRN  \nMOM prn constipation  \nsimvastatin 40 mg Tablet PO DAILY  \nallopurinol ___ mg Tablet Sig:PO DAILY  \npantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release PO Q24H  \ndocusate sodium 100 mg BID  \nsenna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: PO BID  \ntramadol 50 mg PO Q12H  \nmetoclopramide 10 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO QIDACHS  \npolyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose DAILY (Daily).  \nmidodrine 2.5 mg Tablet 6A 11A 4p  \nsimethicone 80 mg Tablet, QID as needed for gas.  \ngabapentin 100 mg HS  \nB complex-vitamin C-folic acid 1 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Cap  \nPO DAILY (Daily).  \npolyvinyl alcohol-povidone 1.4-0.6 % Dropperette Sig: ___  \nDrops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eyes.  \nlevothyroxine 125 mcg DAILY  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Patient was transferred to the CCU for monitoring \nafter pericardiocentesis (no tamponade physiology on echo, \nprocedure performed for diagnostic purposes), who subsequently \ndeveloped fever and hypotension requiring pressure support with \nphenylephrine. He ultimately opted for re-focus of medical \nmanagement to pain management and positioning therapy and was \ndischarged to a rehabilitation facility.\n.\nACTIVE ISSUES\n# GOALS OF CARE: After significant discussion with both his \nfamily and his medical providers the patient voiced his desire \nfor re-focus of his medical management to control of his pain, \nand focus on comfort. These discussions arose in the setting of \ninitiation of permanent dialysis and prolonged and profound \nphysical and emotional decompensation. The patient stated he \nunderstood that termination of dialysis would not be compatible \nwith life. The patient was transferred to a rehabilitation \nfacility for management of pain and positioning therapy.\n.\n# PERICARDIAL EFFUSION: Echo performed on admission demonstrated \nlarge circumferential pericardial effusion, no evidence of \ntamponade. Since the patient had been having transient episodes \nof hypotension during HD sessions, and in order to better \nclarify the etiology of the pericardial fluid, a \npericardiocentesis was performed. Per report, 260 cc of yellow \nserous fluid was removed. Two hours post-procedure the patient \nbecame hypotensive, initially responding to fluid boluses, then \nrequiring Neo for pressure support. He was pan-cultured and \nstarted on broad antibiotics- vancomycin, cefepime and \nmetronidazole. It was noted that his pericardial fluid changed \nin nature from serous to cloudy pink thick fluid. He then became \nfebrile, and received more volume resuscitation for likely \nseptic shock.  Studies were consistent with an exudative \neffusion and culture grew vancomycin resistant enterococcus. \nBroad spectrum antibiotics were discontinued and daptomycin was \nstarted. The source remained unclear, given nothing on imaging \nto support contiguous spread, and highly unlikely that the \nprocedure introduced the organism. Furthermore, blood and urine \ncultures were negative throughout his hospital stay. A TEE was \nnegative for evidence of valvular vegetations. Repeat imaging \nshowed the effusion was resolved and the pericardial drain was \nremoved. He was treated with a 5 day course of Daptomycin before \nantibiotics were discontinued on discharge following the wishes \nof the patient.\n.\n# HYPOTENSION: The patient was noted to be hypotensive on \nadmission, thought to be secondary to hypovolemia from poor PO \nintake. He also had a recent history of transient hypotension \nduring hemodialysis for which he was started on midodrine. \nEchocardiogram revealed an enlarged pericardial effusion \n(details above). Post-pericardiocentesis the patient was treated \nwith fluid resuscitation and broad antibiotics for presumed \nseptic shock. His blood pressure was supported with \nphenylephrine. A ___ test was negative for adrenal \ninsufficiency.  Additionally, albumin of 1.7 so likely has poor \nintravascular osmotic pressure. Given his history of recent \nmedically-managed cholecystitis, and known intra-abdominal fluid \ncollections, a CT torso was obtained to investigate potential \nsources of infection. His HD catheter was removed. Surgery was \nconsulted to investigate possible cholecystitis (details below), \nand ___ performed a drainage of an intraabdominal fluid \ncollection, a hematoma. Serial blood and urine cultures were \nnegative. His hypotension resolved, and he was weaned off \nphenylephrine prior to discharge. His midodrine was increased to \n5 TID. Medical management was discontinued as the patient \ndeclined further medical management.\n.  \n# SUSPECTED CHOLECYSTITIS: The patient had a recent history of \nmedically-managed cholecystitis. On admission he was initially \ntreated with broad spectrum antibiotics, which were then \nnarrowed to Levaquin. Given our clinical concern for sepsis, a \nRUQ ultrasound was obtained and demonstrated a sludge-filled \ngallbladder and a small, unchanged fluid collection. CT torso \ndemonstrated stranding, concerning for acute cholecystitis. \nSurgery was consulted and recommended HIDA scan given low \nsuspicion on physical exam. HIDA scan was positive and a \npercutaneous drain was attempted; however, the procedure was \ncomplicated by collapse of the gallbladder (inconsistent with \nacute cholecystitis) and development of a small hematoma. A \ndrain was placed in the abdominal fluid collection, which \nappeared to be an old hematoma. Microbiology was sent and was \nnegative for growth. The drain was removed.  \n.\n# ESRD on HD: The patient normally receives HD on ___. \nRenal was consulted. HD initially was on hold given new pressor \nrequirement and stable electrolytes. Given concern for sepsis, \nthe tunneled dialysis catheter was removed and replaced with a \ntemporary catheter. Once stable, the patient received CVVH with \nphenylephrine for pressure support. Culture of the catheter tip \nrevealed no growth. A permanent catheter was not placed as the \npatient declined further dialysis.\n.\n# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION with RAPID VENTRICULAR RESPONSE: Present \non admission. The patient spontaneously cardioverted and \nremained in sinus for the rest of his admission. The patient has \n___ S2 score of 3; however, given his history of \nintraabdominal hematomas, we elected to continue aspirin 325 for \nanticoagulation. Medical management was discontinued as the \npatient declined further medical management.\n.\n# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Presented with CP in setting of AF \nwith RVR, found to have ST changes and elevated troponin \nconsistent with demand ischemia. Enzymes were cycled and the \npatient ruled out for an acute myocardial infarction. We \ncontinued his aspirin and statin. Medical management was \ndiscontinued as the patient declined further medical management.\n.\n# ANEMIA: No evidence of acute bleeding. Likely secondary to \nchronic inflammation. Is on Aranesp as outpatient. Hct trended \ndown initially on admission and was stable around 20 at the time \nof discharge. He required a transfusion of 1 unit of pRBCs with \nappropriate response.\n.  \n# THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Relatively stable. Unclear etiology, \nreportedly has chronic ITP, and is status post splenectomy.  \n.\n# PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY: Continued on gabapentin 100 qhs. \nMedical management was discontinued as the patient declined \nfurther medical management.\n.\n# GASTROPARESIS: Continued on metoclopramide 5 mg PO QIDACHS. \nMedical management was discontinued as the patient declined \nfurther medical management.\n.\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n- ___ Management: Management of pain and optimization of \npositional comfort.\n- Pending Studies: Pericardial and Abdominal Fluid Cytology, \nfinalized culture data\n- Code Status: DNR/DNI, do not resuscitate.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nacetaminophen 325 mg Tablet PO Q6H PRN  \nMOM prn constipation  \nsimvastatin 40 mg Tablet PO DAILY  \nallopurinol ___ mg Tablet Sig:PO DAILY  \npantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release PO Q24H  \ndocusate sodium 100 mg BID  \nsenna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: PO BID  \ntramadol 50 mg PO Q12H  \nmetoclopramide 10 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO QIDACHS  \npolyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose DAILY (Daily).  \nmidodrine 2.5 mg Tablet 6A 11A 4p  \nsimethicone 80 mg Tablet, QID as needed for gas.  \ngabapentin 100 mg HS  \nB complex-vitamin C-folic acid 1 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Cap  \nPO DAILY (Daily).  \npolyvinyl alcohol-povidone 1.4-0.6 % Dropperette Sig: ___  \nDrops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eyes.  \nlevothyroxine 125 mcg DAILY  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Patient was transferred to the CCU for monitoring \nafter pericardiocentesis (no tamponade physiology on echo, \nprocedure performed for diagnostic purposes), who subsequently \ndeveloped fever and hypotension requiring pressure support with \nphenylephrine. He ultimately opted for re-focus of medical \nmanagement to pain management and positioning therapy and was \ndischarged to a rehabilitation facility.\n.\nACTIVE ISSUES\n# GOALS OF CARE: After significant discussion with both his \nfamily and his medical providers the patient voiced his desire \nfor re-focus of his medical management to control of his pain, \nand focus on comfort. These discussions arose in the setting of \ninitiation of permanent dialysis and prolonged and profound \nphysical and emotional decompensation. The patient stated he \nunderstood that termination of dialysis would not be compatible \nwith life. The patient was transferred to a rehabilitation \nfacility for management of pain and positioning therapy.\n.\n# PERICARDIAL EFFUSION: Echo performed on admission demonstrated \nlarge circumferential pericardial effusion, no evidence of \ntamponade. Since the patient had been having transient episodes \nof hypotension during HD sessions, and in order to better \nclarify the etiology of the pericardial fluid, a \npericardiocentesis was performed. Per report, 260 cc of yellow \nserous fluid was removed. Two hours post-procedure the patient \nbecame hypotensive, initially responding to fluid boluses, then \nrequiring Neo for pressure support. He was pan-cultured and \nstarted on broad antibiotics- vancomycin, cefepime and \nmetronidazole. It was noted that his pericardial fluid changed \nin nature from serous to cloudy pink thick fluid. He then became \nfebrile, and received more volume resuscitation for likely \nseptic shock.  Studies were consistent with an exudative \neffusion and culture grew vancomycin resistant enterococcus. \nBroad spectrum antibiotics were discontinued and daptomycin was \nstarted. The source remained unclear, given nothing on imaging \nto support contiguous spread, and highly unlikely that the \nprocedure introduced the organism. Furthermore, blood and urine \ncultures were negative throughout his hospital stay. A TEE was \nnegative for evidence of valvular vegetations. Repeat imaging \nshowed the effusion was resolved and the pericardial drain was \nremoved. He was treated with a 5 day course of Daptomycin before \nantibiotics were discontinued on discharge following the wishes \nof the patient.\n.\n# HYPOTENSION: The patient was noted to be hypotensive on \nadmission, thought to be secondary to hypovolemia from poor PO \nintake. He also had a recent history of transient hypotension \nduring hemodialysis for which he was started on midodrine. \nEchocardiogram revealed an enlarged pericardial effusion \n(details above). Post-pericardiocentesis the patient was treated \nwith fluid resuscitation and broad antibiotics for presumed \nseptic shock. His blood pressure was supported with \nphenylephrine. A ___ test was negative for adrenal \ninsufficiency.  Additionally, albumin of 1.7 so likely has poor \nintravascular osmotic pressure. Given his history of recent \nmedically-managed cholecystitis, and known intra-abdominal fluid \ncollections, a CT torso was obtained to investigate potential \nsources of infection. His HD catheter was removed. Surgery was \nconsulted to investigate possible cholecystitis (details below), \nand ___ performed a drainage of an intraabdominal fluid \ncollection, a hematoma. Serial blood and urine cultures were \nnegative. His hypotension resolved, and he was weaned off \nphenylephrine prior to discharge. His midodrine was increased to \n5 TID. Medical management was discontinued as the patient \ndeclined further medical management.\n.  \n# SUSPECTED CHOLECYSTITIS: The patient had a recent history of \nmedically-managed cholecystitis. On admission he was initially \ntreated with broad spectrum antibiotics, which were then \nnarrowed to Levaquin. Given our clinical concern for sepsis, a \nRUQ ultrasound was obtained and demonstrated a sludge-filled \ngallbladder and a small, unchanged fluid collection. CT torso \ndemonstrated stranding, concerning for acute cholecystitis. \nSurgery was consulted and recommended HIDA scan given low \nsuspicion on physical exam. HIDA scan was positive and a \npercutaneous drain was attempted; however, the procedure was \ncomplicated by collapse of the gallbladder (inconsistent with \nacute cholecystitis) and development of a small hematoma. A \ndrain was placed in the abdominal fluid collection, which \nappeared to be an old hematoma. Microbiology was sent and was \nnegative for growth. The drain was removed.  \n.\n# ESRD on HD: The patient normally receives HD on ___. \nRenal was consulted. HD initially was on hold given new pressor \nrequirement and stable electrolytes. Given concern for sepsis, \nthe tunneled dialysis catheter was removed and replaced with a \ntemporary catheter. Once stable, the patient received CVVH with \nphenylephrine for pressure support. Culture of the catheter tip \nrevealed no growth. A permanent catheter was not placed as the \npatient declined further dialysis.\n.\n# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION with RAPID VENTRICULAR RESPONSE: Present \non admission. The patient spontaneously cardioverted and \nremained in sinus for the rest of his admission. The patient has \n___ S2 score of 3; however, given his history of \nintraabdominal hematomas, we elected to continue aspirin 325 for \nanticoagulation. Medical management was discontinued as the \npatient declined further medical management.\n.\n# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Presented with CP in setting of AF \nwith RVR, found to have ST changes and elevated troponin \nconsistent with demand ischemia. Enzymes were cycled and the \npatient ruled out for an acute myocardial infarction. We \ncontinued his aspirin and statin. Medical management was \ndiscontinued as the patient declined further medical management.\n.\n# ANEMIA: No evidence of acute bleeding. Likely secondary to \nchronic inflammation. Is on Aranesp as outpatient. Hct trended \ndown initially on admission and was stable around 20 at the time \nof discharge. He required a transfusion of 1 unit of pRBCs with \nappropriate response.\n.  \n# THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Relatively stable. Unclear etiology, \nreportedly has chronic ITP, and is status post splenectomy.  \n.\n# PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY: Continued on gabapentin 100 qhs. \nMedical management was discontinued as the patient declined \nfurther medical management.\n.\n# GASTROPARESIS: Continued on metoclopramide 5 mg PO QIDACHS. \nMedical management was discontinued as the patient declined \nfurther medical management.\n.\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n- ___ Management: Management of pain and optimization of \npositional comfort.\n- Pending Studies: Pericardial and Abdominal Fluid Cytology, \nfinalized culture data\n- Code Status: DNR/DNI, do not resuscitate.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nacetaminophen 325 mg Tablet PO Q6H PRN  \nMOM prn constipation  \nsimvastatin 40 mg Tablet PO DAILY  \nallopurinol ___ mg Tablet Sig:PO DAILY  \npantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release PO Q24H  \ndocusate sodium 100 mg BID  \nsenna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: PO BID  \ntramadol 50 mg PO Q12H  \nmetoclopramide 10 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO QIDACHS  \npolyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose DAILY (Daily).  \nmidodrine 2.5 mg Tablet 6A 11A 4p  \nsimethicone 80 mg Tablet, QID as needed for gas.  \ngabapentin 100 mg HS  \nB complex-vitamin C-folic acid 1 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Cap  \nPO DAILY (Daily).  \npolyvinyl alcohol-povidone 1.4-0.6 % Dropperette Sig: ___  \nDrops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eyes.  \nlevothyroxine 125 mcg DAILY  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Patient was transferred to the CCU for monitoring \nafter pericardiocentesis (no tamponade physiology on echo, \nprocedure performed for diagnostic purposes), who subsequently \ndeveloped fever and hypotension requiring pressure support with \nphenylephrine. He ultimately opted for re-focus of medical \nmanagement to pain management and positioning therapy and was \ndischarged to a rehabilitation facility.\n.\nACTIVE ISSUES\n# GOALS OF CARE: After significant discussion with both his \nfamily and his medical providers the patient voiced his desire \nfor re-focus of his medical management to control of his pain, \nand focus on comfort. These discussions arose in the setting of \ninitiation of permanent dialysis and prolonged and profound \nphysical and emotional decompensation. The patient stated he \nunderstood that termination of dialysis would not be compatible \nwith life. The patient was transferred to a rehabilitation \nfacility for management of pain and positioning therapy.\n.\n# PERICARDIAL EFFUSION: Echo performed on admission demonstrated \nlarge circumferential pericardial effusion, no evidence of \ntamponade. Since the patient had been having transient episodes \nof hypotension during HD sessions, and in order to better \nclarify the etiology of the pericardial fluid, a \npericardiocentesis was performed. Per report, 260 cc of yellow \nserous fluid was removed. Two hours post-procedure the patient \nbecame hypotensive, initially responding to fluid boluses, then \nrequiring Neo for pressure support. He was pan-cultured and \nstarted on broad antibiotics- vancomycin, cefepime and \nmetronidazole. It was noted that his pericardial fluid changed \nin nature from serous to cloudy pink thick fluid. He then became \nfebrile, and received more volume resuscitation for likely \nseptic shock.  Studies were consistent with an exudative \neffusion and culture grew vancomycin resistant enterococcus. \nBroad spectrum antibiotics were discontinued and daptomycin was \nstarted. The source remained unclear, given nothing on imaging \nto support contiguous spread, and highly unlikely that the \nprocedure introduced the organism. Furthermore, blood and urine \ncultures were negative throughout his hospital stay. A TEE was \nnegative for evidence of valvular vegetations. Repeat imaging \nshowed the effusion was resolved and the pericardial drain was \nremoved. He was treated with a 5 day course of Daptomycin before \nantibiotics were discontinued on discharge following the wishes \nof the patient.\n.\n# HYPOTENSION: The patient was noted to be hypotensive on \nadmission, thought to be secondary to hypovolemia from poor PO \nintake. He also had a recent history of transient hypotension \nduring hemodialysis for which he was started on midodrine. \nEchocardiogram revealed an enlarged pericardial effusion \n(details above). Post-pericardiocentesis the patient was treated \nwith fluid resuscitation and broad antibiotics for presumed \nseptic shock. His blood pressure was supported with \nphenylephrine. A ___ test was negative for adrenal \ninsufficiency.  Additionally, albumin of 1.7 so likely has poor \nintravascular osmotic pressure. Given his history of recent \nmedically-managed cholecystitis, and known intra-abdominal fluid \ncollections, a CT torso was obtained to investigate potential \nsources of infection. His HD catheter was removed. Surgery was \nconsulted to investigate possible cholecystitis (details below), \nand ___ performed a drainage of an intraabdominal fluid \ncollection, a hematoma. Serial blood and urine cultures were \nnegative. His hypotension resolved, and he was weaned off \nphenylephrine prior to discharge. His midodrine was increased to \n5 TID. Medical management was discontinued as the patient \ndeclined further medical management.\n.  \n# SUSPECTED CHOLECYSTITIS: The patient had a recent history of \nmedically-managed cholecystitis. On admission he was initially \ntreated with broad spectrum antibiotics, which were then \nnarrowed to Levaquin. Given our clinical concern for sepsis, a \nRUQ ultrasound was obtained and demonstrated a sludge-filled \ngallbladder and a small, unchanged fluid collection. CT torso \ndemonstrated stranding, concerning for acute cholecystitis. \nSurgery was consulted and recommended HIDA scan given low \nsuspicion on physical exam. HIDA scan was positive and a \npercutaneous drain was attempted; however, the procedure was \ncomplicated by collapse of the gallbladder (inconsistent with \nacute cholecystitis) and development of a small hematoma. A \ndrain was placed in the abdominal fluid collection, which \nappeared to be an old hematoma. Microbiology was sent and was \nnegative for growth. The drain was removed.  \n.\n# ESRD on HD: The patient normally receives HD on ___. \nRenal was consulted. HD initially was on hold given new pressor \nrequirement and stable electrolytes. Given concern for sepsis, \nthe tunneled dialysis catheter was removed and replaced with a \ntemporary catheter. Once stable, the patient received CVVH with \nphenylephrine for pressure support. Culture of the catheter tip \nrevealed no growth. A permanent catheter was not placed as the \npatient declined further dialysis.\n.\n# ATRIAL FIBRILLATION with RAPID VENTRICULAR RESPONSE: Present \non admission. The patient spontaneously cardioverted and \nremained in sinus for the rest of his admission. The patient has \n___ S2 score of 3; however, given his history of \nintraabdominal hematomas, we elected to continue aspirin 325 for \nanticoagulation. Medical management was discontinued as the \npatient declined further medical management.\n.\n# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: Presented with CP in setting of AF \nwith RVR, found to have ST changes and elevated troponin \nconsistent with demand ischemia. Enzymes were cycled and the \npatient ruled out for an acute myocardial infarction. We \ncontinued his aspirin and statin. Medical management was \ndiscontinued as the patient declined further medical management.\n.\n# ANEMIA: No evidence of acute bleeding. Likely secondary to \nchronic inflammation. Is on Aranesp as outpatient. Hct trended \ndown initially on admission and was stable around 20 at the time \nof discharge. He required a transfusion of 1 unit of pRBCs with \nappropriate response.\n.  \n# THROMBOCYTOPENIA: Relatively stable. Unclear etiology, \nreportedly has chronic ITP, and is status post splenectomy.  \n.\n# PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY: Continued on gabapentin 100 qhs. \nMedical management was discontinued as the patient declined \nfurther medical management.\n.\n# GASTROPARESIS: Continued on metoclopramide 5 mg PO QIDACHS. \nMedical management was discontinued as the patient declined \nfurther medical management.\n.\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n- ___ Management: Management of pain and optimization of \npositional comfort.\n- Pending Studies: Pericardial and Abdominal Fluid Cytology, \nfinalized culture data\n- Code Status: DNR/DNI, do not resuscitate.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nacetaminophen 325 mg Tablet PO Q6H PRN  \nMOM prn constipation  \nsimvastatin 40 mg Tablet PO DAILY  \nallopurinol ___ mg Tablet Sig:PO DAILY  \npantoprazole 40 mg Tablet, Delayed Release PO Q24H  \ndocusate sodium 100 mg BID  \nsenna 8.6 mg Tablet Sig: PO BID  \ntramadol 50 mg PO Q12H  \nmetoclopramide 10 mg Tablet Sig: 0.5 Tablet PO QIDACHS  \npolyethylene glycol 3350 17 gram/dose DAILY (Daily).  \nmidodrine 2.5 mg Tablet 6A 11A 4p  \nsimethicone 80 mg Tablet, QID as needed for gas.  \ngabapentin 100 mg HS  \nB complex-vitamin C-folic acid 1 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Cap  \nPO DAILY (Daily).  \npolyvinyl alcohol-povidone 1.4-0.6 % Dropperette Sig: ___  \nDrops Ophthalmic PRN (as needed) as needed for dry eyes.  \nlevothyroxine 125 mcg DAILY  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

The patient was \nvolume depleted on admission and in acute renal failure.  She \nreceived 2L NS in the ED and pressures have improved. There were \nno ECG changes and CE negative x3.  The patient's HCTZ was held \nin the AM and her lisinopril was discontinued over convern for \nrenal artery stenosis. The patient remained euvolemic and did \nnot have any further episodes during her admission after he HCTZ \nwas stopped.

Her \nCXR is interesting for a stable left pleural effusion with only \nmild pulmonary vascular congestion. She was diuresed and \ndischarged to rehab. \n\nACTIVE ISSUES: \n#  CHF exacerbation: the patient presented with SOB and hypoxia \nmost likely due to a CHF exacerbation. The trigger for her \nexacerbation was unclear, but she has been admitted from rehab \nfacility for CHF exacerbations multiple times in the past year. \nIt was possible that d/t agitation and restlessness she had \nhypertensive episodes that caused flash pulmonary edema. Her \ncondition was certainly exacerbated by underlying reactive \nairway disease. She received 80 IV lasix in the ED and continued \nto receive IV lasix on a BID basis for fluid overload. Her urine \noutput was monitored with a Foley. She required periodic 2 L NC \nfor hypoxia, although she was not requiring O2 by day of \ndischarge. During this time, her home torsemide was initially \nstopped. It was recontinued on the day prior to discharge at an \nunchanged dose of 80 mg daily. Her other CHF \nmedications--amlodipine, metoprolol tartrate, and \nvalsartan--were continued. \n\n# tremor: patient was noted to have tremor/shaking on exam in \nthe ED. She had no other focal neurological deficits, although \nthis was difficult to interpret in light of her agitated mental \nstate. Her daughter reports has happened in the past when she \ngets diuretics (confirmed by discharge summaries). This could be \ndue to electrolyte loss but the association between tremor and \nlasix is unclear at the moment. As she continued to receive \ndiuretics, she did not develop worsening of the tremor, and it \nin fact improved such that it was gone by hospital day #2 and \ndid not recur. \n\n# UTI: She had a negative UA on admission, although she has h/o \nsevere UTI in the past. After day #3 with the Foley in place, \nturbid and foul-smelling urine was noted, prompting a repeat UA \nthat showed 12 WBCs and bacteria. She was started on empiric \n5-day course of PO Cipro for UTI, with ucx pending at time of \ndischarge. \n\n#  atrial fibrillation: the patient's home dose of warfarin was \ndecreased to 3 on hospital day #1, and continued at this dose \ngiven supratherapeutic INR, although she missed a dose on ___ \ndue to pharmacy withholding the dose for an INR of 4.7. She was \ndischarged with a changed dose of 2 mg warfarin daily. She was \ncontinued on her home dose of metoprolol.  \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES: \n\n# dementia: patient has h/o dementia and agitated delirium which \nis usual for her in the setting of hospitalizations where she is \nexposed to new people and environments. During her stay, she was \nmore agitated for the first couple of days, and at one point was \nthrowing things at her nurses. ___ was intermittently agitated, \nand completely dis-oriented to place, time, and location which \nis her known norm. She did not require olanzapine (which in the \npast has not been successful). She was continued on her home \n12.5 mg quetiapine and 25 mg tramadol qhs. Beginning on ___, \nshe refused IV access and pulled out her IVs so could not be \ngiven IV meds. She had to be persuaded by ___ staff \nto allow the phlebotomist to draw her blood. She had to be \ncoaxed to take her PO medications with chocolate ice cream, \nwhich she enjoys. \n\n#  CAD: two-vessel disease as seen on cath in ___. She was \ncontinued on her home 81 mg ASA, metoprolol, atorvastatin 10 mg \n  \n#  HTN: she was continued on home metoprolol 50 mg TID, imdur 90 \nmg \n \n#  Reactive airway disease: she was given duonebs as needed for \nSOB \n\n#  CKD: patient's admitting Cr was 1.7, giving her an eGFR of \n24.6. Her outpt nephrologist feels this is most likely a \ncombination of microvascular disease from diabetes and \nhypertension with an overlay of cardiorenal syndrome. Her Cr \nremained stable around 1.5 for most of her stay and increased to \n1.8 on day of discharge, felt to ___ ___ UTI. \n\n***Transitional issues:***\n\n- anticoagulation: Please check INR on ___. Pt is on reduced \ndose of warfarin (2 mg). ___ need to adjust coumadin while on \nabx. \n- torsemide dose: pt will be continued on 80 torsemide daily. \nDiscuss any changes to her HF regimen with heart failure clinic. \n\n- pending labs: please follow up on urine and blood cultures \nfrom this stay.

Her \nCXR is interesting for a stable left pleural effusion with only \nmild pulmonary vascular congestion. She was diuresed and \ndischarged to rehab. \n\nACTIVE ISSUES: \n#  CHF exacerbation: the patient presented with SOB and hypoxia \nmost likely due to a CHF exacerbation. The trigger for her \nexacerbation was unclear, but she has been admitted from rehab \nfacility for CHF exacerbations multiple times in the past year. \nIt was possible that d/t agitation and restlessness she had \nhypertensive episodes that caused flash pulmonary edema. Her \ncondition was certainly exacerbated by underlying reactive \nairway disease. She received 80 IV lasix in the ED and continued \nto receive IV lasix on a BID basis for fluid overload. Her urine \noutput was monitored with a Foley. She required periodic 2 L NC \nfor hypoxia, although she was not requiring O2 by day of \ndischarge. During this time, her home torsemide was initially \nstopped. It was recontinued on the day prior to discharge at an \nunchanged dose of 80 mg daily. Her other CHF \nmedications--amlodipine, metoprolol tartrate, and \nvalsartan--were continued. \n\n# tremor: patient was noted to have tremor/shaking on exam in \nthe ED. She had no other focal neurological deficits, although \nthis was difficult to interpret in light of her agitated mental \nstate. Her daughter reports has happened in the past when she \ngets diuretics (confirmed by discharge summaries). This could be \ndue to electrolyte loss but the association between tremor and \nlasix is unclear at the moment. As she continued to receive \ndiuretics, she did not develop worsening of the tremor, and it \nin fact improved such that it was gone by hospital day #2 and \ndid not recur. \n\n# UTI: She had a negative UA on admission, although she has h/o \nsevere UTI in the past. After day #3 with the Foley in place, \nturbid and foul-smelling urine was noted, prompting a repeat UA \nthat showed 12 WBCs and bacteria. She was started on empiric \n5-day course of PO Cipro for UTI, with ucx pending at time of \ndischarge. \n\n#  atrial fibrillation: the patient's home dose of warfarin was \ndecreased to 3 on hospital day #1, and continued at this dose \ngiven supratherapeutic INR, although she missed a dose on ___ \ndue to pharmacy withholding the dose for an INR of 4.7. She was \ndischarged with a changed dose of 2 mg warfarin daily. She was \ncontinued on her home dose of metoprolol.  \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES: \n\n# dementia: patient has h/o dementia and agitated delirium which \nis usual for her in the setting of hospitalizations where she is \nexposed to new people and environments. During her stay, she was \nmore agitated for the first couple of days, and at one point was \nthrowing things at her nurses. ___ was intermittently agitated, \nand completely dis-oriented to place, time, and location which \nis her known norm. She did not require olanzapine (which in the \npast has not been successful). She was continued on her home \n12.5 mg quetiapine and 25 mg tramadol qhs. Beginning on ___, \nshe refused IV access and pulled out her IVs so could not be \ngiven IV meds. She had to be persuaded by ___ staff \nto allow the phlebotomist to draw her blood. She had to be \ncoaxed to take her PO medications with chocolate ice cream, \nwhich she enjoys. \n\n#  CAD: two-vessel disease as seen on cath in ___. She was \ncontinued on her home 81 mg ASA, metoprolol, atorvastatin 10 mg \n  \n#  HTN: she was continued on home metoprolol 50 mg TID, imdur 90 \nmg \n \n#  Reactive airway disease: she was given duonebs as needed for \nSOB \n\n#  CKD: patient's admitting Cr was 1.7, giving her an eGFR of \n24.6. Her outpt nephrologist feels this is most likely a \ncombination of microvascular disease from diabetes and \nhypertension with an overlay of cardiorenal syndrome. Her Cr \nremained stable around 1.5 for most of her stay and increased to \n1.8 on day of discharge, felt to ___ ___ UTI. \n\n***Transitional issues:***\n\n- anticoagulation: Please check INR on ___. Pt is on reduced \ndose of warfarin (2 mg). ___ need to adjust coumadin while on \nabx. \n- torsemide dose: pt will be continued on 80 torsemide daily. \nDiscuss any changes to her HF regimen with heart failure clinic. \n\n- pending labs: please follow up on urine and blood cultures \nfrom this stay.

Her \nCXR is interesting for a stable left pleural effusion with only \nmild pulmonary vascular congestion. She was diuresed and \ndischarged to rehab. \n\nACTIVE ISSUES: \n#  CHF exacerbation: the patient presented with SOB and hypoxia \nmost likely due to a CHF exacerbation. The trigger for her \nexacerbation was unclear, but she has been admitted from rehab \nfacility for CHF exacerbations multiple times in the past year. \nIt was possible that d/t agitation and restlessness she had \nhypertensive episodes that caused flash pulmonary edema. Her \ncondition was certainly exacerbated by underlying reactive \nairway disease. She received 80 IV lasix in the ED and continued \nto receive IV lasix on a BID basis for fluid overload. Her urine \noutput was monitored with a Foley. She required periodic 2 L NC \nfor hypoxia, although she was not requiring O2 by day of \ndischarge. During this time, her home torsemide was initially \nstopped. It was recontinued on the day prior to discharge at an \nunchanged dose of 80 mg daily. Her other CHF \nmedications--amlodipine, metoprolol tartrate, and \nvalsartan--were continued. \n\n# tremor: patient was noted to have tremor/shaking on exam in \nthe ED. She had no other focal neurological deficits, although \nthis was difficult to interpret in light of her agitated mental \nstate. Her daughter reports has happened in the past when she \ngets diuretics (confirmed by discharge summaries). This could be \ndue to electrolyte loss but the association between tremor and \nlasix is unclear at the moment. As she continued to receive \ndiuretics, she did not develop worsening of the tremor, and it \nin fact improved such that it was gone by hospital day #2 and \ndid not recur. \n\n# UTI: She had a negative UA on admission, although she has h/o \nsevere UTI in the past. After day #3 with the Foley in place, \nturbid and foul-smelling urine was noted, prompting a repeat UA \nthat showed 12 WBCs and bacteria. She was started on empiric \n5-day course of PO Cipro for UTI, with ucx pending at time of \ndischarge. \n\n#  atrial fibrillation: the patient's home dose of warfarin was \ndecreased to 3 on hospital day #1, and continued at this dose \ngiven supratherapeutic INR, although she missed a dose on ___ \ndue to pharmacy withholding the dose for an INR of 4.7. She was \ndischarged with a changed dose of 2 mg warfarin daily. She was \ncontinued on her home dose of metoprolol.  \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES: \n\n# dementia: patient has h/o dementia and agitated delirium which \nis usual for her in the setting of hospitalizations where she is \nexposed to new people and environments. During her stay, she was \nmore agitated for the first couple of days, and at one point was \nthrowing things at her nurses. ___ was intermittently agitated, \nand completely dis-oriented to place, time, and location which \nis her known norm. She did not require olanzapine (which in the \npast has not been successful). She was continued on her home \n12.5 mg quetiapine and 25 mg tramadol qhs. Beginning on ___, \nshe refused IV access and pulled out her IVs so could not be \ngiven IV meds. She had to be persuaded by ___ staff \nto allow the phlebotomist to draw her blood. She had to be \ncoaxed to take her PO medications with chocolate ice cream, \nwhich she enjoys. \n\n#  CAD: two-vessel disease as seen on cath in ___. She was \ncontinued on her home 81 mg ASA, metoprolol, atorvastatin 10 mg \n  \n#  HTN: she was continued on home metoprolol 50 mg TID, imdur 90 \nmg \n \n#  Reactive airway disease: she was given duonebs as needed for \nSOB \n\n#  CKD: patient's admitting Cr was 1.7, giving her an eGFR of \n24.6. Her outpt nephrologist feels this is most likely a \ncombination of microvascular disease from diabetes and \nhypertension with an overlay of cardiorenal syndrome. Her Cr \nremained stable around 1.5 for most of her stay and increased to \n1.8 on day of discharge, felt to ___ ___ UTI. \n\n***Transitional issues:***\n\n- anticoagulation: Please check INR on ___. Pt is on reduced \ndose of warfarin (2 mg). ___ need to adjust coumadin while on \nabx. \n- torsemide dose: pt will be continued on 80 torsemide daily. \nDiscuss any changes to her HF regimen with heart failure clinic. \n\n- pending labs: please follow up on urine and blood cultures \nfrom this stay.

Her \nCXR is interesting for a stable left pleural effusion with only \nmild pulmonary vascular congestion. She was diuresed and \ndischarged to rehab. \n\nACTIVE ISSUES: \n#  CHF exacerbation: the patient presented with SOB and hypoxia \nmost likely due to a CHF exacerbation. The trigger for her \nexacerbation was unclear, but she has been admitted from rehab \nfacility for CHF exacerbations multiple times in the past year. \nIt was possible that d/t agitation and restlessness she had \nhypertensive episodes that caused flash pulmonary edema. Her \ncondition was certainly exacerbated by underlying reactive \nairway disease. She received 80 IV lasix in the ED and continued \nto receive IV lasix on a BID basis for fluid overload. Her urine \noutput was monitored with a Foley. She required periodic 2 L NC \nfor hypoxia, although she was not requiring O2 by day of \ndischarge. During this time, her home torsemide was initially \nstopped. It was recontinued on the day prior to discharge at an \nunchanged dose of 80 mg daily. Her other CHF \nmedications--amlodipine, metoprolol tartrate, and \nvalsartan--were continued. \n\n# tremor: patient was noted to have tremor/shaking on exam in \nthe ED. She had no other focal neurological deficits, although \nthis was difficult to interpret in light of her agitated mental \nstate. Her daughter reports has happened in the past when she \ngets diuretics (confirmed by discharge summaries). This could be \ndue to electrolyte loss but the association between tremor and \nlasix is unclear at the moment. As she continued to receive \ndiuretics, she did not develop worsening of the tremor, and it \nin fact improved such that it was gone by hospital day #2 and \ndid not recur. \n\n# UTI: She had a negative UA on admission, although she has h/o \nsevere UTI in the past. After day #3 with the Foley in place, \nturbid and foul-smelling urine was noted, prompting a repeat UA \nthat showed 12 WBCs and bacteria. She was started on empiric \n5-day course of PO Cipro for UTI, with ucx pending at time of \ndischarge. \n\n#  atrial fibrillation: the patient's home dose of warfarin was \ndecreased to 3 on hospital day #1, and continued at this dose \ngiven supratherapeutic INR, although she missed a dose on ___ \ndue to pharmacy withholding the dose for an INR of 4.7. She was \ndischarged with a changed dose of 2 mg warfarin daily. She was \ncontinued on her home dose of metoprolol.  \n\nCHRONIC ISSUES: \n\n# dementia: patient has h/o dementia and agitated delirium which \nis usual for her in the setting of hospitalizations where she is \nexposed to new people and environments. During her stay, she was \nmore agitated for the first couple of days, and at one point was \nthrowing things at her nurses. ___ was intermittently agitated, \nand completely dis-oriented to place, time, and location which \nis her known norm. She did not require olanzapine (which in the \npast has not been successful). She was continued on her home \n12.5 mg quetiapine and 25 mg tramadol qhs. Beginning on ___, \nshe refused IV access and pulled out her IVs so could not be \ngiven IV meds. She had to be persuaded by ___ staff \nto allow the phlebotomist to draw her blood. She had to be \ncoaxed to take her PO medications with chocolate ice cream, \nwhich she enjoys. \n\n#  CAD: two-vessel disease as seen on cath in ___. She was \ncontinued on her home 81 mg ASA, metoprolol, atorvastatin 10 mg \n  \n#  HTN: she was continued on home metoprolol 50 mg TID, imdur 90 \nmg \n \n#  Reactive airway disease: she was given duonebs as needed for \nSOB \n\n#  CKD: patient's admitting Cr was 1.7, giving her an eGFR of \n24.6. Her outpt nephrologist feels this is most likely a \ncombination of microvascular disease from diabetes and \nhypertension with an overlay of cardiorenal syndrome. Her Cr \nremained stable around 1.5 for most of her stay and increased to \n1.8 on day of discharge, felt to ___ ___ UTI. \n\n***Transitional issues:***\n\n- anticoagulation: Please check INR on ___. Pt is on reduced \ndose of warfarin (2 mg). ___ need to adjust coumadin while on \nabx. \n- torsemide dose: pt will be continued on 80 torsemide daily. \nDiscuss any changes to her HF regimen with heart failure clinic. \n\n- pending labs: please follow up on urine and blood cultures \nfrom this stay.

LAD The left anterior descending coronary \nartery is with 100% mid occlusion. D1 is with 90% proximal focal \nfollowed by a region of long diffuse 80-90%. Circ The circumflex \ncoronary artery is with widely patent prior stents and smooth \n70% focal OM1. RCA The right coronary artery is with 100% mid \nin-stent chronic occlusion. There are left-to-right and rightto- \nright collaterals present. Interventional Details Percutaneous \nCoronary Intervention: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) \nwas performed on an ad hoc basis based on the coronary \nangiographic findings from the diagnostic portion of this \nprocedure. A 6 ___ EBU3.5 guide provided adequate support. \nHeparin given and a therapeutic ACT confirmed. Crossed easily \nwith a Scion Blue wire into the distal LAD. Dottered and \npredilated with a 2.0 mm balloon at 10 atm restoring antegrade \nflow. Further predilated with a 3.0 mm balloon at ___ atm and \nthen deployed a 3.0mm x 32mm DES at 12 atm post-dilated with a \n3.0mm NC balloon at ___ atm. The patient had improving chest \nand arm discomfort at procedure end. Final angiography revealed \nnormal flow, no dissection and 0% residual stenosis. \nComplications: There were no clinically significant \ncomplications\n\nTTE ___\nThe left atrial volume index is normal. There is normal left \nventricular wall thickness with a normal cavity size. There is \nSEVERE regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with \nthinning and akinesis of the basal inferior and inferolateral \nsegments (old infarct), as well as near-akinesis of the mid- and \ndistal anterior wall, anterior septum and apex (see schematic) \nand preserved/normal contractility of the remaining segments. \nThese findings are consistent with multivessel CAD. A small \nnonmobile mural left ventricular THROMBUS is seen, abutting the \nLV apex and distal septum. Quantitative 3D volumetric left \nventricular ejection fraction is 28 %. There is no resting left \nventricular outflow tract gradient. No ventricular septal defect \nis seen. Normal right ventricular cavity size with normal free \nwall motion. The aortic sinus diameter is normal for gender with \nnormal ascending aorta diameter for gender. The aortic arch \ndiameter is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly \nthickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. There is trace \naortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets appear \nstructurally normal with no mitral valve prolapse. There is mild \n[1+] mitral regurgitation. The tricuspid valve leaflets appear \nstructurally normal. There is mild [1+] tricuspid regurgitation. \nThere is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is \nno pericardial effusion. IMPRESSION: Severe regional left \nventricular systolic dysfunction, c/w multivessel disease, prior \ninferoposterior MI and a more recent anteroapical infarction. \nSmall apical LV thrombus. MIld mitral regurgitation. Mild \npulmonary hypertension. Compared with the prior TTE (images not \navailable for review) of ___, LV function has declined, \nwith new LAD-territory regional dysfunction.

It seems he has had 2 episodes of word finding \ndifficulty in the last several months. Differential includes \nTIAs, Strokes, Amyloid Angiopathy, Seizures, Migraines. On exam, \nhe has a sixth nerve palsy which is likely chronic since he \ndoesn't complain of double vision. Given the acute onset, short \nduration of his symptoms with return to baseline, evidence of \nsmall vessel ischemic disease on MR and recent history of \nelevated blood pressures, TIA is the likely cause of his \nsymptoms. CT and MR did not show signs of intracranial bleeding, \nmass effect, ischemia or large vessel stenosis. A seizure was \nalso considered as a possible cause of his symptoms, however no \nseizure activity or epileptiform discharges were seen on EEG. \nAmyloid angiopathy is also a potential cause of his symptoms, \nthough there is no evidence of microbleeds on imaging. Lastly, \nhis symptoms could also be due to migraines, however he has no \nhistory of migraines or chronic headaches. \n\nFinal diagnosis: TIA\n\n# Aphasia:\n- No further episodes of aphasia were noted in the examination.  \nMRI/A demonstrated no stroke, or vascular anomaly.  EEG \ndemonstrated no focal abnormality or area of epileptogenesis.  \n\n# Hypertension:\nBP autoregulated on ___ dose of atenolol in the 160-180 range, \nwith no significant improvement on addition of HCTZ and full \ndose atenolol.  We added Norvasc 5mg daily, and a one-time dose \nof Hydralazine. Should follow up with PCP office to recheck BP \nday after discharge.\n\n# Vascular risk factors:\nLipids were well controlled with LDL in ___ and HDL in high ___. \n No medications were started while inpatient. HbA1c 5.1.  \nTelemetry revealed no concerning ectopy.\n\n# TRANSITIONS OF CARE:\n- Added Norvasc 5mg daily\n- ___ follow up with Dr. ___\n- ___ follow up with PCP regarding BP check and management\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1. Atenolol 50 mg PO DAILY \n2. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg PO DAILY \n3. Leuprolide Acetate IM Frequency is Unknown \n4. Tamsulosin 0.4 mg PO HS \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

We performed a CT scan as well as MRI \nstudies of your blood vessels and brain which demonstrated no \nstroke, bleeding, or mass lesion concerning for tumor.  We also \nperformed an EEG which demonstrated no seizure activity as a \ncause for your word finding difficulty.  \n\nAs each of these episodes occured after you had delivered a \nthree-hour lecture, it is quite possible that these episodes \nwere brought on by fatigue.  We also stratified your \ncerebrovascular risk factors with blood work which showed \nexcellent control of your cholesterol.  We also performed a test \nof your blood sugar control which can be followed upon with your \nneurologist Dr. ___ as an outpatient.  \n\nWe did note that even with your blood pressure medications \nrestarted, you still had elevated blood pressures which were in \nthe 180-200 range.  For this, we started a new medication, \nNorvasc (amlodipine) at a low dose for better BP control. You \nshould follow up with your PCP's office tomorrow (___) to \nhave your blood pressure checked.

Given ongoing concern for medication \neffect, a Psychiatry consultation was obtained, who recommended \nreducing quetiapine (due to patient's previously noted episodic \nsinus tachycardia), follow-up with outpatient sleep specialist, \nand considering alternatives to benzodiazepines for anxiety \nmanagement. These concerns were also discussed with patient's \nprimary care provider, who also expressed concerns regarding \npatient's opioid regimen, from which he was being weaned in the \nperiod preceding admission.\n\nWith respect to cardiac evaluation for syncope, transthoracic \nechocardiogram did not reveal concerning findings, and event \nmonitor was ordered prior to discharge.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n1.

Episodes of altered mental status: Review of ambulatory EEG \nobtained between patient's admissions as well as continuous \nvideo EEG during this hospitalization again did not reveal clear \nepileptiform activity on preliminary review, although changes \nconsistent with his prior TBI were noted. Chest x-ray and \nlaboratory testing did not reveal evidence of infection. \nPatient's mental status otherwise improved during the admission \nwithout intervention. Given ongoing concern for medication \neffect, a Psychiatry consultation was obtained, who recommended \nreducing quetiapine (due to patient's previously noted episodic \nsinus tachycardia), follow-up with outpatient sleep specialist, \nand considering alternatives to benzodiazepines for anxiety \nmanagement. These concerns were also discussed with patient's \nprimary care provider, who also expressed concerns regarding \npatient's opioid regimen, from which he was being weaned in the \nperiod preceding admission.\n\nWith respect to cardiac evaluation for syncope, transthoracic \nechocardiogram did not reveal concerning findings, and event \nmonitor was ordered prior to discharge.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n1. Follow up event monitoring for possible arrhythmias.\n2. Consider switching to a non-benzodiazepine agent for anxiety.\n3.

Your mental \nstatus cleared following admission, and review of your EEG (both \nfrom before the hospitalization and during) preliminarily did \nnot show signs of seizures. Testing did not show signs of an \ninfection, and an ultrasound of your heart (echocardiogram) did \nnot show signs of severe heart valve disease that could have \nlimited blood flow to your brain. You were also fitted with an \nevent monitor prior to leaving the hospital to look for \narrhythmias.\n\nYou were also evaluated by the Psychiatry service, who \nrecommended decreasing your dose of quetiapine at night and \ntalking to your outpatient providers about switching from \nclonazepam to a different medication for your anxiety. An \nappointment was also scheduled with the Sleep Clinic due to your \nsleep issues, which may be contributing to your symptoms.\n\nIt was a pleasure taking care of you at ___.\n\nSincerely,\nNeurology at ___\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___", "question": "What symptom does the patient experience more frequently when lying down to go to bed?", "answer_text": "intermittent palpitations", "answer_start": 841}

No intracranial hemorrhage identified.\n(Note: appears to have been present on Head CT ___, but much \nsmaller at that time)\n\nCXR ___:\nCXR showed no acute process. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ male with metastatic L renal clear cell carcinoma in \nthe setting of an atrophic right kidney and chronic renal \nfailure, currently on pazopanib and steroids presenting with \npersistent N/V and new retro-orbital mass on NCHCT.\n\n# Metastatic RCC: Tolerating pazopanib fairly well with minimal\nnausea at last clinic visit. Pazopanib had been held in ___ in case of infection, as he was having more nausea than \nbefore and reporting mouth pain. Resumed pazopanib on ___. \nHe did not take pazopanib for 4 days PTA given nausea/vomiting. \nHe is on 10mg Prednisone daily (for chemo/gout) but had not \ntaken his dose for 4 days PTA ___ nausea/vomiting. Pt had CT \ntorso w/o contrast on ___ for routine cancer staging (was \nscheduled as outpatient for ___ but performed in-house for pt \nconvenience), which showed unchanged small scattered mediastinal \nLNs, no new pulmonary nodules, an indeterminate hyperdense \nexophytic lesion arising from the upper pole of the left kidney \nmeasuring 16 x 19 mm (previously 12 x 16 mm), known renal cell \ncarcinoma arising from the interpolar left kidney that is \npartially exophytic and measuring 26 x 30 mm (previously 26 x 32 \nmm), known atrophic right kidney, and stable retroperitoneal \nlymphadenopathy.

PERRL, \nEOMI, no pain with eye movements, no double or blurry vision per \npt, possible inferior visual field defect on exam (but Dr. \n___ Neuro ___ did not appreciate any visual field \ndeficits). Suspect that this lesion is most likely a vascular \nstructure. Patient was scheduled to follow-up with ophthalmology \nregarding further evaluation of this lesion.  Further imaging \ncould be considered including open MRI with contrast, although \nhis CKD is borderline for gadolinium contrast. \n\n# Nausea/vomiting: Resolved and pt tolerating PO by HD2 after \nstarting ceftriaxone for suspected UTI. Therefore, \nnausea/vomiting was most likely related to UTI, as pt reports \nnausea/vomiting with prior UTIs. On presentation, pt was not \nendorsing urinary urgency/frequency/dysuria, but UA with large \n___, >182 WBCs, and few bacteria. Urine cx with mixed bacterial \nflora. Cannot rule out that nausea/vomiting is due to viral \ngastroenteritis or side effect of pazopanib (although had not \ntaken for 4 days PTA). Unlikely GI/biliary source of \nnausea/vomiting as LFTs and tbili were WNL. Pt discharged with 4 \nmore days of cipro to complete 7-day course of UTI treatment. \nPazopanib held throughout admission and per outpatient \noncologist, Dr. ___ should restart it while at rehab. \nPt discharged with PRN PO Zofran, PO Compazine, and PO Ativan \nfor possible nausea related to pazopanib. Pt instructed to take \nPO Compazine 30 minutes prior to his pazopanib dose to reduce \nrisk of nausea, although QTc should be checked prior to \ninitiating this regimen, as pt has not required Compazine or \nZofran in the hospital and will be initiating Cipro to start at \n___. \n\n# UTI: Has h/o recurrent UTIs. Pt not reporting dysuria, \nfrequency, or urgency on admission. UA on admission with large \n___, >182 WBCs, and few bacteria. Urine cx with mixed bacterial \nflora. Initially treated with ceftriaxone, and nausea/vomiting \nresolved. Given improvement in nausea/vomiting symptoms after \nstarting UTI treatment, pt discharged with ciprofloxacin for 4 \ndays to end on ___ for a total of a 7 day course of abx.\n\n# Thrush: Given thrush on examination and poor dentition, \nconcern for oropharyngeal candidiasis. Pt should continue \nNystatin swish and swallow QID PRN.\n\n# Poor Dentition and Mouth/Cheek Pain/Paresthesia: Pt reports \nhaving L molar extraction in ___ with paresthesia in \ncheek and continued pain in mouth. OMFS consulted. Per their \nexam, no appreciable asymmetric edema in his cheeks. Panorex \nordered, and per their read no obvious orthodontic infection or \nsource of pain/paresthesia. Could not definitively r/o \nmetastasis to jaw with x-rays, so consider PET CT as outpatient \n(as above). Started Peridex mouth rinse BID and \nBenadryl/Maalox/Lidocaine mouthwash TID PRN mouth pain. Pt \nshould f/u with outpatient dentist for further management of \npoor dentition.\n\n# H/o Fall at Home: Pt with at least two recent mechanical falls \nat home. ___ consult saw him and recommended acute rehab due to \nrisk for falls given decreased balance, decreased muscle \nstrength, falls history, and pain.  Expect less than 2 week \nduration of stay.   \n\n# Gout: No evidence of recurrence. Continued renally dosed \nallopurinol and prednisone.\n\n# CKD: CKD likely due to RCC on left and atrophic right kidney. \nCr in-house 2.1 -> 1.9, both of which appear to be about his \nbaseline.  \n\n# Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine continued. \n\nTransitional Issues: \n[] Ativan should be first line choice for nausea\n[] Pt should restart pazopanib at rehab.\n[] Pt should continue ciprofloxacin 500mg PO BID x4 days after \ndischarge, QTc should be checked prior to administration of \nCompazine or Zofran after starting cipro\n[] Routine surveillance CT C/A/P w/o contrast had been ordered \nto be performed as an outpatient on ___ but was performed as \nan inpatient for pt convenience. Outpatient oncologist should \nf/u the results of the CT C/A/P, and can consider PET CT as \noutpatient for further cancer staging/monitoring. \n[] Outpatient oncologist can consider ordering outpatient open \nMRI head with gadolinium with thin cuts through the orbits to \nfurther characterize 1.3cm retro-orbital lesion that was seen on \n___ ___.\n[] Pt should follow up with oculoplastic orbital specialist on \n___ at 10:00am for new retro-orbital lesion. \n[] Pt started on Peridex mouth wash BID and \nBenadryl/Maalox/Lidocaine mouthwash TID PRN for mouth pain. Pt \nshould follow up with his outpatient dentist for further \nmanagement of his poor dentition. \n[] QTc should be checked prior to giving Zofran or Compazine, as \npt has not required these medications in-house. \n\nCode Status: Full\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

The \nscattered \ncalcified granulomas are noted. There is no new or growing \npulmonary nodule.  There is no focal consolidation or pleural \neffusion. Enlargement of the main pulmonary artery is unchanged \nand suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Deformity of \nthe xiphoid process and degenerative changes in the spine are \nnoted. An indeterminate hyperdense exophytic lesion arising from \nthe upper pole of \nthe left kidney measures 16 x 19 mm, previously 12 x 16 mm. \nKnown renal cell carcinoma arising from the interpolar left \nkidney is partially exophytic measuring 26 x 30 mm, previously \n26 x 32 mm. The right kidney is atrophic. A double-J right \nureteral stent is again noted.

No periosteal reaction is seen. \n\nNoncon CT head ___:\n1. New 1.3 cm right retro-orbital lesion, for which the\ndifferential includes a soft tissue mass such as a lymphoma\nversus a vascular abnormality arising from the superior\nophthalmic vein. Further characterization with an MRI is\nrecommended.  2. No intracranial hemorrhage identified.\n(Note: appears to have been present on Head CT ___, but much \nsmaller at that time)\n\nCXR ___:\nCXR showed no acute process. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ male with metastatic L renal clear cell carcinoma in \nthe setting of an atrophic right kidney and chronic renal \nfailure, currently on pazopanib and steroids presenting with \npersistent N/V and new retro-orbital mass on NCHCT.\n\n# Metastatic RCC: Tolerating pazopanib fairly well with minimal\nnausea at last clinic visit. Pazopanib had been held in ___ in case of infection, as he was having more nausea than \nbefore and reporting mouth pain. Resumed pazopanib on ___. \nHe did not take pazopanib for 4 days PTA given nausea/vomiting. \nHe is on 10mg Prednisone daily (for chemo/gout) but had not \ntaken his dose for 4 days PTA ___ nausea/vomiting. Pt had CT \ntorso w/o contrast on ___ for routine cancer staging (was \nscheduled as outpatient for ___ but performed in-house for pt \nconvenience), which showed unchanged small scattered mediastinal \nLNs, no new pulmonary nodules, an indeterminate hyperdense \nexophytic lesion arising from the upper pole of the left kidney \nmeasuring 16 x 19 mm (previously 12 x 16 mm), known renal cell \ncarcinoma arising from the interpolar left kidney that is \npartially exophytic and measuring 26 x 30 mm (previously 26 x 32 \nmm), known atrophic right kidney, and stable retroperitoneal \nlymphadenopathy. Pazopanib held during admission and will be \nrestarted at rehab. Prednisone 10mg daily continued. Pt may need \nPET as outpatient for staging given known metastatic disease.\n\n# Retro-orbital Lesion on ___:\nCT head ___ showed 1.3cm retro-orbital lesion that had been \npresent on CT ___ but was much smaller at that time. PERRL, \nEOMI, no pain with eye movements, no double or blurry vision per \npt, possible inferior visual field defect on exam (but Dr. \n___ Neuro ___ did not appreciate any visual field \ndeficits). Suspect that this lesion is most likely a vascular \nstructure. Patient was scheduled to follow-up with ophthalmology \nregarding further evaluation of this lesion.  Further imaging \ncould be considered including open MRI with contrast, although \nhis CKD is borderline for gadolinium contrast. \n\n# Nausea/vomiting: Resolved and pt tolerating PO by HD2 after \nstarting ceftriaxone for suspected UTI. Therefore, \nnausea/vomiting was most likely related to UTI, as pt reports \nnausea/vomiting with prior UTIs. On presentation, pt was not \nendorsing urinary urgency/frequency/dysuria, but UA with large \n___, >182 WBCs, and few bacteria. Urine cx with mixed bacterial \nflora. Cannot rule out that nausea/vomiting is due to viral \ngastroenteritis or side effect of pazopanib (although had not \ntaken for 4 days PTA). Unlikely GI/biliary source of \nnausea/vomiting as LFTs and tbili were WNL. Pt discharged with 4 \nmore days of cipro to complete 7-day course of UTI treatment. \nPazopanib held throughout admission and per outpatient \noncologist, Dr. ___ should restart it while at rehab. \nPt discharged with PRN PO Zofran, PO Compazine, and PO Ativan \nfor possible nausea related to pazopanib. Pt instructed to take \nPO Compazine 30 minutes prior to his pazopanib dose to reduce \nrisk of nausea, although QTc should be checked prior to \ninitiating this regimen, as pt has not required Compazine or \nZofran in the hospital and will be initiating Cipro to start at \n___. \n\n# UTI: Has h/o recurrent UTIs. Pt not reporting dysuria, \nfrequency, or urgency on admission. UA on admission with large \n___, >182 WBCs, and few bacteria. Urine cx with mixed bacterial \nflora. Initially treated with ceftriaxone, and nausea/vomiting \nresolved. Given improvement in nausea/vomiting symptoms after \nstarting UTI treatment, pt discharged with ciprofloxacin for 4 \ndays to end on ___ for a total of a 7 day course of abx.\n\n# Thrush: Given thrush on examination and poor dentition, \nconcern for oropharyngeal candidiasis. Pt should continue \nNystatin swish and swallow QID PRN.\n\n# Poor Dentition and Mouth/Cheek Pain/Paresthesia: Pt reports \nhaving L molar extraction in ___ with paresthesia in \ncheek and continued pain in mouth. OMFS consulted. Per their \nexam, no appreciable asymmetric edema in his cheeks. Panorex \nordered, and per their read no obvious orthodontic infection or \nsource of pain/paresthesia. Could not definitively r/o \nmetastasis to jaw with x-rays, so consider PET CT as outpatient \n(as above). Started Peridex mouth rinse BID and \nBenadryl/Maalox/Lidocaine mouthwash TID PRN mouth pain. Pt \nshould f/u with outpatient dentist for further management of \npoor dentition.\n\n# H/o Fall at Home: Pt with at least two recent mechanical falls \nat home. ___ consult saw him and recommended acute rehab due to \nrisk for falls given decreased balance, decreased muscle \nstrength, falls history, and pain.  Expect less than 2 week \nduration of stay.   \n\n# Gout: No evidence of recurrence. Continued renally dosed \nallopurinol and prednisone.\n\n# CKD: CKD likely due to RCC on left and atrophic right kidney. \nCr in-house 2.1 -> 1.9, both of which appear to be about his \nbaseline.  \n\n# Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine continued. \n\nTransitional Issues: \n[] Ativan should be first line choice for nausea\n[] Pt should restart pazopanib at rehab.\n[] Pt should continue ciprofloxacin 500mg PO BID x4 days after \ndischarge, QTc should be checked prior to administration of \nCompazine or Zofran after starting cipro\n[] Routine surveillance CT C/A/P w/o contrast had been ordered \nto be performed as an outpatient on ___ but was performed as \nan inpatient for pt convenience. Outpatient oncologist should \nf/u the results of the CT C/A/P, and can consider PET CT as \noutpatient for further cancer staging/monitoring. \n[] Outpatient oncologist can consider ordering outpatient open \nMRI head with gadolinium with thin cuts through the orbits to \nfurther characterize 1.3cm retro-orbital lesion that was seen on \n___ ___.\n[] Pt should follow up with oculoplastic orbital specialist on \n___ at 10:00am for new retro-orbital lesion. \n[] Pt started on Peridex mouth wash BID and \nBenadryl/Maalox/Lidocaine mouthwash TID PRN for mouth pain.

No intracranial hemorrhage identified.\n(Note: appears to have been present on Head CT ___, but much \nsmaller at that time)\n\nCXR ___:\nCXR showed no acute process. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ male with metastatic L renal clear cell carcinoma in \nthe setting of an atrophic right kidney and chronic renal \nfailure, currently on pazopanib and steroids presenting with \npersistent N/V and new retro-orbital mass on NCHCT.\n\n# Metastatic RCC: Tolerating pazopanib fairly well with minimal\nnausea at last clinic visit. Pazopanib had been held in ___ in case of infection, as he was having more nausea than \nbefore and reporting mouth pain. Resumed pazopanib on ___. \nHe did not take pazopanib for 4 days PTA given nausea/vomiting. \nHe is on 10mg Prednisone daily (for chemo/gout) but had not \ntaken his dose for 4 days PTA ___ nausea/vomiting. Pt had CT \ntorso w/o contrast on ___ for routine cancer staging (was \nscheduled as outpatient for ___ but performed in-house for pt \nconvenience), which showed unchanged small scattered mediastinal \nLNs, no new pulmonary nodules, an indeterminate hyperdense \nexophytic lesion arising from the upper pole of the left kidney \nmeasuring 16 x 19 mm (previously 12 x 16 mm), known renal cell \ncarcinoma arising from the interpolar left kidney that is \npartially exophytic and measuring 26 x 30 mm (previously 26 x 32 \nmm), known atrophic right kidney, and stable retroperitoneal \nlymphadenopathy. Pazopanib held during admission and will be \nrestarted at rehab. Prednisone 10mg daily continued. Pt may need \nPET as outpatient for staging given known metastatic disease.\n\n# Retro-orbital Lesion on ___:\nCT head ___ showed 1.3cm retro-orbital lesion that had been \npresent on CT ___ but was much smaller at that time. PERRL, \nEOMI, no pain with eye movements, no double or blurry vision per \npt, possible inferior visual field defect on exam (but Dr. \n___ Neuro ___ did not appreciate any visual field \ndeficits). Suspect that this lesion is most likely a vascular \nstructure. Patient was scheduled to follow-up with ophthalmology \nregarding further evaluation of this lesion.  Further imaging \ncould be considered including open MRI with contrast, although \nhis CKD is borderline for gadolinium contrast. \n\n# Nausea/vomiting: Resolved and pt tolerating PO by HD2 after \nstarting ceftriaxone for suspected UTI. Therefore, \nnausea/vomiting was most likely related to UTI, as pt reports \nnausea/vomiting with prior UTIs. On presentation, pt was not \nendorsing urinary urgency/frequency/dysuria, but UA with large \n___, >182 WBCs, and few bacteria. Urine cx with mixed bacterial \nflora. Cannot rule out that nausea/vomiting is due to viral \ngastroenteritis or side effect of pazopanib (although had not \ntaken for 4 days PTA). Unlikely GI/biliary source of \nnausea/vomiting as LFTs and tbili were WNL. Pt discharged with 4 \nmore days of cipro to complete 7-day course of UTI treatment. \nPazopanib held throughout admission and per outpatient \noncologist, Dr. ___ should restart it while at rehab. \nPt discharged with PRN PO Zofran, PO Compazine, and PO Ativan \nfor possible nausea related to pazopanib. Pt instructed to take \nPO Compazine 30 minutes prior to his pazopanib dose to reduce \nrisk of nausea, although QTc should be checked prior to \ninitiating this regimen, as pt has not required Compazine or \nZofran in the hospital and will be initiating Cipro to start at \n___. \n\n# UTI: Has h/o recurrent UTIs. Pt not reporting dysuria, \nfrequency, or urgency on admission. UA on admission with large \n___, >182 WBCs, and few bacteria. Urine cx with mixed bacterial \nflora. Initially treated with ceftriaxone, and nausea/vomiting \nresolved. Given improvement in nausea/vomiting symptoms after \nstarting UTI treatment, pt discharged with ciprofloxacin for 4 \ndays to end on ___ for a total of a 7 day course of abx.\n\n# Thrush: Given thrush on examination and poor dentition, \nconcern for oropharyngeal candidiasis. Pt should continue \nNystatin swish and swallow QID PRN.\n\n# Poor Dentition and Mouth/Cheek Pain/Paresthesia: Pt reports \nhaving L molar extraction in ___ with paresthesia in \ncheek and continued pain in mouth. OMFS consulted. Per their \nexam, no appreciable asymmetric edema in his cheeks. Panorex \nordered, and per their read no obvious orthodontic infection or \nsource of pain/paresthesia. Could not definitively r/o \nmetastasis to jaw with x-rays, so consider PET CT as outpatient \n(as above). Started Peridex mouth rinse BID and \nBenadryl/Maalox/Lidocaine mouthwash TID PRN mouth pain. Pt \nshould f/u with outpatient dentist for further management of \npoor dentition.\n\n# H/o Fall at Home: Pt with at least two recent mechanical falls \nat home. ___ consult saw him and recommended acute rehab due to \nrisk for falls given decreased balance, decreased muscle \nstrength, falls history, and pain.  Expect less than 2 week \nduration of stay.   \n\n# Gout: No evidence of recurrence. Continued renally dosed \nallopurinol and prednisone.\n\n# CKD: CKD likely due to RCC on left and atrophic right kidney. \nCr in-house 2.1 -> 1.9, both of which appear to be about his \nbaseline.  \n\n# Hypothyroidism: Levothyroxine continued. \n\nTransitional Issues: \n[] Ativan should be first line choice for nausea\n[] Pt should restart pazopanib at rehab.\n[] Pt should continue ciprofloxacin 500mg PO BID x4 days after \ndischarge, QTc should be checked prior to administration of \nCompazine or Zofran after starting cipro\n[] Routine surveillance CT C/A/P w/o contrast had been ordered \nto be performed as an outpatient on ___ but was performed as \nan inpatient for pt convenience. Outpatient oncologist should \nf/u the results of the CT C/A/P, and can consider PET CT as \noutpatient for further cancer staging/monitoring. \n[] Outpatient oncologist can consider ordering outpatient open \nMRI head with gadolinium with thin cuts through the orbits to \nfurther characterize 1.3cm retro-orbital lesion that was seen on \n___ ___.\n[] Pt should follow up with oculoplastic orbital specialist on \n___ at 10:00am for new retro-orbital lesion. \n[] Pt started on Peridex mouth wash BID and \nBenadryl/Maalox/Lidocaine mouthwash TID PRN for mouth pain. Pt \nshould follow up with his outpatient dentist for further \nmanagement of his poor dentition. \n[] QTc should be checked prior to giving Zofran or Compazine, as \npt has not required these medications in-house. \n\nCode Status: Full\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

He was seen by ___ consult service in \nhouse who recommended continuing to monitor blood sugars while \nhe receives dexamethasone as an outpatient and holding off on \nstarting ISS as an outpatient. However, if FSBG, remain elevated \nabove 250 he will need to start NPH 4U with his dose of \ndexamethasone.\n\n# Malignant hypertensive retinopathy: Patient was seen again in \nhouse by ophthalmology. He will follow up as outpatient in ___ \nweeks.\n \n# Anemia: Patient's Hb 10 on admission, down from baseline 12. \nLikely secondary to chronic kidney disease and multiple myeloma. \nNo evidence of active bleeding and patient denied black or \nbloody stool. Hemoglobin remained stable throughout admission.\n \n# HLD: Continued atorvastatin, will continue aspirin.\n\n# Bone mineral disease: Patient with elevated PTH and low \nvitamin D consistent with bone mineral disease secondary to CKD. \nHe was continued on home Vitamin D repletion. \n\n# CODE: Full (confirmed)  \n# CONTACT: Wife ___ ___  \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n[ ] ___ to check BGs 4 hours after taking dexamethasone \nand at bedtime.
