LEGAL \u0026 SAFETY: \n\nThe patient signed a conditional voluntary agreement (Section 10 \n\u0026 11) with agreement to engage in medical work-up and allow for \ncoordination of ___ with her outpatient medical and psychiatric \nproviders. She was also placed on q15 minute checks status on \nadmission and remained on that level of observation throughout \nwhile being unit restricted. She did not require physical or \nchemical restraints during this hospitalization. \n\n \n\n2. PSYCHIATRIC:\n\nUpon admission, interview was limited due to active psychotic \nsymptoms,\nnamely thought blocking and loosening of associations. Pt had \nvague reports of AH, paranoid thinking, and made contradictory \nstatements around medication adherence. Mental status \nexamination was notable for a disheveled woman in no acute \ndistress, who was oddly related, with blunted and apathetic \naffect. Thought content was notable for auditory hallucinations, \npossible paranoia. Her thought process quickly derailed with \nloosening of associations, thought blocking, poverty of thought. \n\n\nThe patient’s presentation was concerning for decompensation of \nher underlying chronic psychosis, likely either schizophrenia \nversus schizoaffective disorder, although she does not report \nsignificant affective symptoms at this time. This all occurring \nin the likely setting of medication nonadherence.\n\nThe patient was restarted on home medications, risperidone 1 mg \nBID and escitalopram 15 mg daily, which was increased to 20 mg \ndaily. Patient was compliant with escitalopram and found it to \nbe useful for her mood, however declined risperidone during \nhospitalization. She felt her SSRI offered her relief from \nsymptoms, and felt antipsychotics had not been useful in the \npast. Patient's outpatient providers voiced that they are okay \nwith this plan. Subsequent to her admission interview the \npatient was more organized. She did not demonstrate any positive \nsymptoms of schizophrenia but was isolative to her bedroom, \nalthough cited physical respiratory impairment as the reason she \ndid not leave her room frequently.\n\nDuring hospitalization, patient continued to have symptoms of \ndyspnea and chest\npain on the unit. Patient's level of psychosis did not warrant \nthe petitioning for treatment with antipsychotics over her \nobjection as she is able to engage in treatment planning for her \nmedical issues and is motivated to follow up with necessary \ntesting, cardiac medications, and a discharge plan to a medical \nshelter. She has demonstrated good behavioral control on the \nunit, and collateral from outpatient providers did not raise a \nconcern that the patient was unable to ___ for herself in the \ncommunity due to her psychiatric illness. However, her dyspnea \nand obesity do appear to limit her mobility to the point where \nshe has difficulty picking up medications and attending medical \nappointments. Therefore, would benefit from medical workup at \nthis time.  \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\nCurrently there is no acute psychiatric concern. Psychiatric \nconsult service does not need to be consulted at this time.\n- Increased escitalopram to 20 mg daily \n- Patient declining risperidone, which her outpatient providers \nare comfortable with\n- Records from ___ and ___  ___ \n___ have been requested. We will forward them to the internal \nmedicine service when they arrive. \n- We were considering discharge to ___ ___ for \nmedical respite. Contact for admissions is ___ \n- When patient is ready for discharge, please schedule \npsychiatry follow-up at ___ for the Homeless with \n___, NP (___) \n- PCP is ___ at ___ for the Homeless \n___\n\n3. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS:\nN/A\n\n4. MEDICAL\n#Chest pain and dyspnea with EKG changes: On arrival, pt \nreported ongoing dyspnea and chest pain on exertion. Repeat EKG \nwas unchanged from prior, CTA chest was negative, and CK and \nTrop x2 were negative. Medicine was consulted and felt symptoms \nwere consistent with stable angina. Recommended obtaining \nmedical records requested from hospitals in ___ to assess \nfor history of CHF and history of stress test, inpatient TTE, \nand outpatient stress test. \n\n#HTN: Continued amLODIPine 10 mg PO/NG DAILY, Furosemide 20 mg \nPO/NG DAILY, and CARVedilol 12.5 mg PO/NG BID. Consulted \nmedicine for further recommendations. Recommended continuing \ncarvedilol 12.5 mg BID, with plan to uptitrate by 6.25 mg \nincrements every few days to reach goal BP \u003c 130/80, up to a max \nof 25 mg BID.\n\n#Urinary incontinence: Patient has history consistent with urge \nincontinence. This was monitored during hospitalization. \n\n#Breast and lung nodules: Nodules found incidentally on CT \nchest. Per medicine recs, will have patient follow-up \noutpatient. \n\n \n\n5. PSYCHOSOCIAL\n\n#) GROUPS/MILIEU: \n\nThe patient was encouraged to participate in the various groups \nand milieu therapy opportunities offered by the unit. The \npatient was often isolative in her room but was visible in day \nroom during meals. Though patient was encouraged to attend  \ngroups that focused on teaching patients various coping skills, \nshe did not attend. However, she was always appropriate in her \ninteraction with peers and staff without ever requiring \nrestraint or seclusion. \n \n\n#) COLLATERAL INFORMATION AND  FAMILY INVOLVEMENT\n\nCollateral was obtained from her outpatient psychiatric \nprescriber. The patient did not allow contact with her family \nwho are located in ___. \n\nCollateral from psychiatric nurse practitioner at ___ for the Homeless, ___, NP Office: ___\nPaging: ___\n\nMet for first time on ___. \nArrived in ___ in early ___ on a Grey Hound from ___.\nPresented to ___ with SOB and admitted her to ___\ndue to thinking it was more of a psychiatric concern.

Has had multiple\nantipsychotic trials which were not successful. She was \nagreeable\nto Lexapro on ___ in the outpatient setting but she was not\nagreeable to Risperidone. She had trouble picking up her\nmedication at pharmacy due to dyspnea. \nShe has been living at the ___. She has not \nleft\nthe shelter during the day. She sits in one spot. She had some\nfecal incontinence with remnants of feces on the chair on \n___. She left the shelter in shame on ___ due to the hubbub\ncaused by staff in response to her incontinence.  NP ___ and\n___ PCP have had significant concern about her ability to ___\nfor herself due to not being able to leave the shelter or go to\nthe pharmacy from her dyspnea. \n\nThe team was making a plan to admit her to the ___\nHouse for a medical respite.  PCP ___ is in support of\nthis. \n\nThey submitted a DMH application 2 weeks ago but she needs to be\nliving in the state for 6 months before she can be eligible for\nservices. \n \n\n#) INTERVENTIONS\n\n- Medications: Anti-hypertensives, Risperidone, Escitalopram \n\n- Psychotherapeutic Interventions: Individual, group, and milieu \ntherapy.\n\n- Coordination of aftercare: Transition to medical floor, no \nplan to re-admission to deaconess 4. Pt referred to ___ \n___ House on ___. Contact for admissions is \n___\n\n- Behavioral Interventions: encourage coping skills\n\n- Guardianships: N/A\n\n \n\nRISK ASSESSMENT \u0026 PROGNOSIS\n\nOn presentation, the patient was evaluated and felt to be at an \nincreased risk of harm to herself due to concern for inability \nto ___ for self. Her risk factors noted at that time included \nhistory of suicide attempts, chronic mental illness, recent \ndischarge from an inpatient psychiatric unit, limited social \nsupports, unemployment, homelessness, psychosis, medication \nnoncompliance, and thought constriction. Modifiable risk factors \nwere addressed during hospitalization via medication management, \npsychotherapeutic intervention, and aftercare coordination.  The \npatient is being discharged with many protective risk factors, \nincluding female gender, age, future-oriented viewpoint, lack of \nsuicidal ideation, investment in her medical ___ and connection \nwith outpatient treaters. Given the above, my overall assessment \nis that the patient's suicide risk at time of discharge is low.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1. amLODIPine 10 mg PO DAILY \n2.

Subacute infarctions in the right frontal lobe, right \nparietal lobe right coronal radiata, and right basal ganglia. \n  \n2. Incomplete MRA of the head due to patient inability to \ntolerate the \nexamination. However, there is irregularity and narrowing of the \nright M1 \nsegment noted on this limited study. \n\nTTE ___:\nThe left atrium is normal in size. With maneuvers, there is \nearly appearance of agitated saline/microbubbles in the left \natrium/left ventricle most consistent with a patent foramen \novale. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and \nregional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF = 65%). Right \nventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The \naortic valve is bicuspid. There is no aortic valve stenosis. \nTrace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears \nstructurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is \nborderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a \nsmall pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic signs \nof tamponade. \n\nIMPRESSION: patent foramen ovale; bicuspid aortic valve; no \nvegetations seen  \n\nTEE ___\nIMPRESSION: Bicuspid aortic valve with moderately thickened \nleaflets and a very small, bright mobile echodensity on the LVOT \nside (brightness is atypical for vegetation, but cannot \ncompletely exclude in the correct clinical context). Mild aortic \nregurgitation. Mild mitral regurgitation. No discrete \nvegetation/thrombus seen on the indwelling PICC line. Small \natrial septal defect with left-to-right flow. Simple atheroma in \ndescending thoracic aorta. Small pericardial effusion.\n\nCT Chest ___:\nNew bilateral lower lobe interlobular septal thickening and \nbronchial wall thickening may be due to infection or edema.  \nThis is superimposed on an increased background of diffuse \nground-glass opacities and cysts, which may be due to \nlymphocytic interstitial pneumonia. Pneumocystis jiroveci \npneumonia is considered less likely given the presence of \npleural effusions. \n  \nNew small right and a stable moderate left pleural effusion, \nwhich is now \npartially loculated. \n  \nNo appreciable interval change in mediastinal and bilateral \naxillary \nlymphadenopathy, which may related to HIV. \n  \nStable small pericardial effusion. \n  \nSimilar size and extent of multiple indeterminate non FDG avid \nsclerotic bone lesions involving the sternum, spine and ribs. \n\nLower Extremity Dopplers ___:\nNo evidence of deep venous thrombosis in the bilateral lower \nextremity veins.\n\nMRI/MRA Head/Neck ___:\n1. Interval development of new acute infarcts of the posterior \nright frontal and parietal lobes. Redemonstrated are \nsuperimposed acute to subacute infarcts of the right MCA \ndistribution. No abnormal enhancement noted to suggest \ninflammatory or neoplastic etiologies. However, correlate \nclinically and if necessary consider followup to assess for any \ninterval change. \n  \n2. Severe narrowing of the right distal M1 segment.  The \netiology is uncertain and may represent atherosclerotic disease \nalthough vasculitis or other vascular disorders is a \ndifferential consideration. \nIn addition, there is multifocal mild nonocclusive narrowing of \nthe bilateral M1 segments. If there is high clinical concern for \nvasculitis, CTA or conventional cerebral angiogram would be much \nmore sensitive. \nNo evidence of aneurysm larger than 3 mm in the circle ___. \n  \n3. The left vertebral artery is not visualized from its origin \nto the level of the distal V4 segment, which may be \nchronic/congenital given the relative small size of the left \ncervical transverse foramina seen on prior PET-CT and lack of \nvisualization of the proximal left vertebral artery on prior CTA \nchest performed on ___. However, superimposed \nocclusion of the left congenitally hypoplastic vertebral artery \nis not entirely excluded. \n\n4. Mildly enlarged nodes in the upper neck, largest measuring \napproximately 2.7 cm in the CC dimension, inadequately assessed. \n\nHypointense marrow signal. Correlate clinically and with labs \nfor better assessment given the history. \n\n5.  Paranasal sinus disease and fluid in the mastoid air cells \nas described above. \n\n6.  Degenerative changes in the cervical spine not adequately \nassessed as not targeted. \n\nCTA Head ___:\n1. Evolving right cerebral hemisphere hypodensities and mild \nsulcal effacement compatible with known right MCA territory \ninfarct. \n2. There is severe irregularity and narrowing of the \nintracranial \nvasculature,, most prominently involving the right M1 segment \nand some distal branches, which may be secondary to vasculitis, \npossibly in relation to HIV although reversible vasoconstriction \nsyndrome remains a diagnostic consideration. \n3. Hypoplastic V4 segment of the left vertebral artery although \nportions of the V4 segment are not well visualized, a more \nproximal stenosis/ occlusion is not excluded. \n4. No evidence of pathologic large vessel occlusion or aneurysm \nwithin the intracranial vasculature. \n\nKUB ___:\nA PE supine radiographs of the abdomen where reviewed \n  \nThere is evidence of multiple dilated bowel loops, with some \nmildly abnormal appearance of the wall especially of the large \nbowel. There is potential for presence of intraperitoneal fluid \ngiving the centered position of the bowel loops.  No definitive \nevidence of obstruction is seen. If clinically warranted, \ncorrelation with cross-sectional imaging is to be considered. \n\nAbdominal Ultrasound with Doppler ___:\n1.

On exam he has left sided weakness, left facial \ndroop, and left neglect, which is improving. He also has \npapilledema and was found to have a multifocal pneumonia at \nadmission. He underwent an extensive workup to identify a \nunifying diagnosis that would explain his entire presentation.  \nHowever the differential still remains broad and includes \nmalignancy, angio-invasive infection, and vasculitis.\n\n# Right MCA Stroke: \nHe has multifocal areas of infarct on MRI that progressed on \nsubsequent MRIs. Vessel imaging revealed right M1 stenosis as \netiology. Given his normal lipid panel, splenic infarcts, and \nlack of HTN, DDx included infection, intravascular lymphoma, \nendocarditis, systemic hypercoagulability, and vasculitis as \nwell as atherosclerosis as the etiology of vasculopathy. TTE and \nTEE showed an atrial septal defect with left-to-right flow, no \nclear vegetations, though there was a \"bright mobile \nechodensity\" on the aortic valve which is atypical in appearance \nfor a vegetation. Lower extremity venous ultrasound was negative \nfor DVT. He was started on aspirin for secondary prevention. \nHematology was consulted for hypercoagulability workup. While \nhis protein C and antithrombin levels were decreased, it was \nfelt they were not sufficiently low to cause thrombosis.  He was \ntreated with IV fluids and head of bed less than 30 degrees to \noptimize cerebral perfusion. ___ and OT were consulted and \nrecommended acute rehab. Pt had witnessed overt aspiration of \nthin liquids but not thick liquids or solids. Speech language \npathology was consulted and recommended nectar thick liquids to \nprevent further aspiration.\n\n# Peripheral edema: Thought to be a combination of his \nmalnutrition and fluid overload from resuscitation in setting of \nMCA stroke. He was started on TPN and diuresed with furosemide \nIV with improvement in his scrotal and leg edema. He was started \non furosemide PO at discharge. \n\n# Failure to thrive/chronic diarrhea: Extensive workup has been \nunrevealing and the differential remains broad, including \nmalignant, infectious, and vasculitic etiologies. ANCA was \nnegative and abdominal CTA did not indicate vasculitis, and skin \nbiopsy ruled out intravascular lymphoma. Lymph node biopsy was \nalso nonspecific. Universal PCR of lymph node tissue is pending \nat discharge.  He has undergone extensive GI workup outpatient. \nGI team was consulted and stools studies were unrevealing. GI \nbiopsies showed ileitis and diffuse inflammation, but was \nnegative for Whipple's disease on PAS stain. Amyloidosis was \nconsidered, and ___ red stain of his GI biopsies is pending at \ndischarge. His diarrhea was treated symptomatically with \ntincture of opium improvement. He had some abdominal bloating \nwith tincture of opium so dose was decreased to BID:PRN \ndiarrhea. He was started on TPN with improvement in his malaise. \nHis chronic anemia also slowly worsened during this admission \ngiven phlebotomy and poor PO intake. He was transfused 1 unit \npRBC prior to discharge for Hgb of 7.8 (down from ___ at \nadmission.\n \n# Lymphadenopathy: \nHe has diffuse lymphadenoapthy seen on CT scans and thyroid \nultrasound. He was seen by surgical oncology and underwent a \nright supraclavicular lymph node biopsy. Pathology was benign \nand showed a nonspecific reactive process. SPEP/UPEP was \nnegative for monoclonal gammopathy. POEMS syndrome was initially \nproposed as a possible unifying diagnosis, however he did not \nmeet criteria for this. His EBV PCR was positive for viremia at \na level of 6353, however ID was consulted and felt this was due \nto reactivation in the setting of his underlying illness and was \nnot the primary cause of his overall presentation.\n\n# Papilledema: \nPapilledema was noted on dilated neurology admission exam. He \nhad no pleocytosis on LP and no meningeal enhancement on MRI, \nruling out. His opening pressure on lumbar puncture was 19. \nGiven temporal lobe enhancement, was treated with acyclovir \nempirically pending his HSV PCR results, with pre and post \nhydration to protect his kidneys. Ophthalmology was consulted \nand confirmed papilledema on dilated exam. He will need \noutpatient followup. \n\n# Community Acquired Pneumonia: \nCXR on admission showed a multifocal PNA (new from ___ CXR) \nconsistent with an atypical or viral process. CT chest was \nsuspicious for LIP (lymphoid interstitial pneumonia), however \npulmonology did not feel biopsy was indicated given stability of \nhis respiratory status. He was treated with CTX/azithromycin for \ncommunity acquired pneumonia and completed a 7-day course. He \nhad a witnessed aspiration event during his lymph node biopsy \nand during evaluation by Speech Language Pathology. He was \nbriefly febrile but recovered quickly, so fever was attributed \nto aspiration pneumonitis. He was placed on a diet of nectar \nthick liquids to prevent further aspiration.\n\n# HIV: \nWell controlled on anti-retroviral medication. Most recent CD4 \n948, HIV VL undetectable ___. Has never had AIDS. Continued \nhis home Atripla (non-formulary so substituted with efavirenz \n600 daily and emtricitabine-tenofovir 200/300 daily). Rechecked \nhis viral load which was undetectable.\n\n# Hypothyroidism: \nHas diffuse thyroiditis on ultrasound and elevated anti-TPO \nantibodies consistent with Hashimoto thyroiditis. He had \nreactions to levothyroxine in the past so was untreated. \nEndocrine was consulted and felt the allergy may have been to \nthe dye in the pills. He was started in levothyroxine with a \nformulation without dyes and tolerated the trial well without \nrash or other complications. His dose was titrated accordingly \nand he will follow up in ___ clinic for further \ntitration.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n- Consider further workup of sclerotic bone lesions, such as \nPET/CT or bone biopsy. \n- Consider further workup of bright echodensity on aortic valve \nseen on TEE. Cardiac MR was considered to better visualize this \nfinding, however on discussion with cardiology, this modality \nhas never been validated for endocarditis and thus further \nimaging was deferred. \n- Consider further workup of chronic splenic infarctions.\n- Consider further monitoring and workup of EBV viral load.\n- Needs ophthalmology followup for papilledema evaluation.\n- Needs GI, hematology/oncology, endocrinology, neurology, and \nID followup for continued workup of his failure to thrive.\n- Follow up pending studies: TSH/T4; ___ red stain of GI \ntissue\n- Please check CBC and Chem 10 at least weekly at rehab to \nmonitor anemia and electrolytes while on furosemide and to \nappropriately formulate TPN.\n- Please consider stopping furosemide once peripheral edema is \nresolved.\n- Patient has worse leg edema on the left leg compared to the \nright. Lower extremity venous ultrasound was negative for DVT. \n- Please only give colorless 50mcg levothyroxine tabs, as \npatient is allergic to the dye in other pills.\n- if work-up remains unrevealing, can consider course of empiric \nsteroids for non-specific inflammation seen on GI biopsies\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

DRESS is \nfulfilled given eosinophilia, new medication, systemic symptoms. \nActually very characteristic of phenytoin and carbemazapine \nhypersensitivity. Likely due to former given had been taken for \nnear a month and the latter only taken once. Nonetheless, both \nagents should now be avoided. We It is likely that these two \nsigns are related, given the onset of each. This is consistent \nwith phenytoin hypersensitivity and infectious etiologies. \nPhenytoin hypersensitivities can also cause blood dyscrasias, \nlymphadenopathy, hepatitic liver enzymes, eosinophilia. This is \nquite well described (See abstract below). Phenytoin \nhypersensitivity actually accounts for all manifestations and \nwould be the most elegant explanation. Infectious disease can \nalso be considered, particularly including EBV, CMV. \nHematological processes are also possible. Skin biopsy may be of \nassistance. \n  Pathology report from skin biopsy, not finalized, but \navailable: \"Interface dermatitis with mild epidermal spongiosis, \nfocal erythrocyte extravasation, and superficial to mid dermal \nperivascular lymphohistiocytic inflammation with scattered \neosinophils (see note).\"\n  He was observed in the MICU for 24 hours.  He was started on \nsolumedrol 1 mg/kg per day (50 mg/day, clobetasol ointment to \nbody, hydrocortisone to face, aquophor and vaseline to lips.  He \nwas given benadryl for the itching and a panel of labs were sent \nincluding HIV, HepC, EBV, Lyme titers, and a punch biopsy was \nsent by dermatology.  TFTs on ___ were normal. Laboratory \nfindings were essentially only consistent with DRESS/Dilantin \nhypersensitivity. He was transferred to the floor where steroids \nwere increase to 125 mg IV Solumedrol daily for four days, \nprednisone taper was then commenced at 60 mg with a plan to \ntaper by 10 mg every 4 days, then 5mg for four days. He was also \ngiven famotidine and IV Benadryl on the floor. Rash and other \nsymptoms clear quickly. \n   \nFevers\n  Had two to three days of fevers in conjunction with the rash, \nhowever he was afebrile in the MICU for his ___ 24 hours.  Blood \nand urine cultures were sent, CXR was done which was \nunremarkable.  As above, a number of labs were sent to determine \npossible infective causes.  He was consented to HIV which was \nalso sent and found to be negative. He returned an equivocal \nresult for HBV shell antibody. Equivocal Lyme was found in ___ \n___, but both here were negative. \n\nBody aches / headache\n  Likely related to flu-like syndrome associated with reaction, \nas part of DRESS. Body aches improved over MICU course and with \nibuprofen as needed. Infectious etiologies effectively excluded. \n\n  \nElevated LFTs\n  No history liver disease or alcohol abuse. Intermediate levels \nconsistent with viremia, but excluded on testing. Again part of \nthis DRESS. These will need to be followed closely for \nresolution.\n  \nAnemia\n  Unclear etiology, iron studies not consistent necessarily with \niron deficiency anemia.  In setting of acute illness, his CBCs \nwere followed. Hemolysis was possible earlier in his \npresentation. \n  \nAbdominal Pain\n  Appeared on first day of hospitalisation and was improved by \nsteroids. Was not helped by Maalox (initially though likely ___ \nsteroids with reflux and gastritis). Given normal KUB and AUS, \nwe now think that this likely represented para-aortic and \nretroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, perhaps mesenteric adenopathy. \nThis resolved with other features during steroid treatement. He \nwas briefly given opioids, but later required no pain \nmedications. \n\n'Seizures'\n  Differential includes REM sleep behavior disorder, night \nterrors, restless legs symdrome with periodic limb movements and \nepilepsies - most likely of which is familial nocturnal frontal \nlobe epilepsy. Parasomnias are very unlikely based on family \nhistory and history of the present illness. The description was \nclassic for nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. The age of onset \nfor NFLE is correct, but this may well be non-familial, or we \nmay not understand his pedigree or relatives' history well (also \nnot completely penetrant or noticed). REM sleep behavior \ndisorder not consistent with history (no narcoleptic symptoms). \nNo earlier onset PD. First line is typically carbemazepine, but \nthis is now contraindicated. Given the natural history of this \ndisorder, treatment may not be necessary (typically resolves \nwith aging). He will see Neurology as an outpatient. He was not \nstarted on treatment.\n\nRelated Abstract:\n\n___. Phenytoin Hypersensitivity - 38 Cases. NEUROLOGY \n___.\n\nTo determine the frequency and severity of hypersensitivity \nreactions to phenytoin, we reviewed 38 cases of proven \nreactions. Patients were included only if no other drugs, \nincluding other anticonvulsants, were in use at the time of the \nreaction. Rashes were most frequent, followed by fever, \nlymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, abnormal liver function tests, \nblood dyscrasias, serum sickness, renal failure, and \npolymyositis. The pseudolymphoma syndrome (fever, rash, and \nlymphadenopathy) occurred in nine patients. ___ of the \n38 reactions occurred within 2 months of the start of therapy. \nPhenytoin sensitivity accounted for 467 inpatient days during \nthe ___ years of study. Early recognition of phenytoin reactions, \nprompt drug withdrawal, and appropriate therapeutic measures are \nnecessary to prevent serious morbidity from phenvtoin \nhypersensitivity. \n \nMedications on Admission:\nPrednisone 40 mg daily for 2 weeks  \nFamotidine 20 mg BID  \nAtarax 25 mg TID PRN  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

Since 5pm last evening\npt stated he had intrusive impulsive thoughts of \"grabbing a\nknife\" and \"stabbing myself a bunch of times.\"   He was able to\n\"control\" the thoughts while watching with Olympics with his\nmother, and attempted to sleep around 10pm. Sleep was poor last \nnight, and this AM he was unable to control the thoughts and \ncame\nto the ED.  He is extremely distressed by this, and is very\nworried he may not be able to control the urge.  Denies any urge\nto hurt anyone else.   He also thought about  taking all of his\nmedications in order to OD.  Here in the ED he feels somewhat\nsafe, but states the thought of ramming his head into the glass\nhas occurred to him.

DISCHARGED AFTER \nIMPROVEMENT O/N WITH TOPICAL STEROIDS. \n\n# CONTACT DERMATITIS:\nThree common conditions for the presentation of crusting scaly \nplaques with pruritus, excoriations, and attendant edema with \nerythema and warmth include atopic dermatitis, contact \ndermatitis, and infectious cellulitis.  An atopic picture is \nconsistent with his history of itchiness and cracking skin \nlesions prior to any exposure to possible skin irritants.  \nMoreover, atopic dermatitis can be exacerbated by exposure to \nchemical irritants, which can further dry out the skin and lead \nto itchiness and scratching-induced excoriations.\n\nThe history of exposure to an irritant points in the diagnostic \ndirection of contact dermatitis.  But the fact that his symptoms \npredated the exposure by days-to-weeks argues against CD.  \nFurther, the lack of leukocytosis and systemic symptoms in the \npresence of pruritus suggest contact dermatitis or atopic \ndermatitis vs. infectious cellulitis.  However, it is certainly \npossible that a secondary infection could occur due to a \ndisrupted skin barrier due to primary dermatitis.  Another \ninfectious etiological possibility could include a fungal \ninfection (such as tinea versicolor from Malassezia), especially \nconsidering the pathcy hypo-to-hyperpigmentation distribution in \nthe abdomen worsened with sweating.\n\nOther inflammatory or immune processes could be to blame, such \nas psoriasis.  However, psoriasis is unlikely given the lack of \nsilver plaques on an erythematous base and the lack of extensor \nsurface involvement. Of course, several of these processes could \nbe operating concurrently. \n\nWe also considered underlying systemic conditions such as DM, \nHIV and Hep C that might predispose him to immunodeficiency \nleading to susceptibility to fungal or scabies infection over a \nwider skin surface.  However, this was unlikely in the context \nof his negative HIV result and the negative ___ prep looking for \nfungal involvement as well as the negative scabies prep, though \nthese tests do not definitively rule out tinea pedis or scabies. \n Overall, our initial clinical interpretation prior to punch \nbiopsy results was that this could be a combination of atopic \nand contact dermatitis.  One uncommon cause discussed was \nnecrotizing acral erythema, which is a hyperkeratotic \nerythematous eruption resembling psoriasis typically seen in \npatients with hepatitis C infection. Ultimately, the prelim \npathological determination per derm was that this is contact \ndermatitis on ___.\n\nWe treated the pt initially with topical corticosteroid \n(hydrocortisone 1%) and controlled pruritus with 1G \nantihistamine (diphenhydramine 25 mg q6h). We consulted \ndermatology in the AM on ___ who recommended switching to \nclobetasol (0.05% ointment BID), which was begun in the ___ on \n___.  He was discharged on the clobetasol ointment, which \nshould be applied to the affected areas on the leg and trunk for \na maximum of 2 weeks duration.

Poor study quality. Grossly preserved \nbiventricular function.\n\nEKG:\nSR, borderline LAE\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ female with history of recurrent C.\ndifficile infection who presents with fatigue, diarrhea,\nshortness of breath found to have hypotension, ___ (creatinine\n4.0 on admission, baseline \u003c1.0) improving with IVF, epigastric\npain on exam, and requiring ongoing treatment for chronic C. \nDiff. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES: \n==================\n[ ] Will have prolonged Vanco taper per GI recs: \n - 125mg QID x 10d, until ___\n - 125mg BID x 7d, ___ to ___\n - 125mg Daily until GI follow-up appt on ___ \n[ ] Discussed with patient holding PPI, which is likely \nworsening her C.Diff, but she declined given severe GERD\n[ ] Needs close outpatient cardiology follow-up given her HFpEF, \nongoing shortness of breath, and concern for possible \nover-diuresis contributing to her ___ on presentation; may need \nfurther titration \n[ ] Can consider transitioning from 80mg Lasix every day to 10mg \ntorsemide daily\n[ ] Consider restarting Lisinopril as an outpatient. Held on \ndischarge due to soft BPs. \n[ ] Needs to be evaluated for CPAP as OP (has documented OSA, \nreportedly in process of getting a CPAP, but so far has not yet \nreceived one). Expect that her OSA is a major contributor to her \nshortness of breath. \n\nACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:\n====================\n# Acute Kidney Injury: \nPatient was having ongoing diarrhea and was hypotensive to 82/43\nwhile in ED. Her creatinine on ___ was 4.0, but has improved\nwith 3L LR and 1L NS to 0.6 on ___. This is likely pre-renal in\netiology likely related to her diarrhea and increased dose of\nfurosemide. Of note, her lasix dose was recently increased by \nPCP ___\n80 mg to 160 mg (80mg BID). This was likely contributing to her \n___, and was decreased to 80mg once per day. Her metoprolol and \nlisinopril were held during the hospitalization. \n\n# Diarrhea with history of recurrent C. Diff \nMs. ___ presented with ongoing diarrhea in the setting of \ncontinued vancomycin treatment for C. diff infection. She has \nhad 4 infections with C. diff in the past ___ years. During this \nhospitalization, C. Diff PCR positive, toxin negative. H. Pylori \nnegative. She was previously considered for FMT but plans were \nfor further evaluation as an outpatient. Her diarrhea improved \nduring her hospitalization with plans to continue the vancomycin \ntaper as an outpatient. Recommend discussion of downtitrating \npantoprazole in the setting of increased C. diff risk. \n\n# Dyspnea \n# Acute hypoxemic respiratory failure (resolved)\nThe etiology of her hypoxemia and dyspnea is not entirely clear\nat this point. While in the ED, Ms. ___ recieved extensive\nworkup for her SOB. On imaging, CXR was clear and pulmonary exam\nwas unremarkable. Therefore, low concern for CHF exacerbation\nwith pulmonary edema. Unlikely to be cardiac etiology due to low\nproBNP and troponins \u003c0.01. Furthermore, EKG was also within\nnormal limits. Also, pulmonary embolism unlikely given normal\nlower extremity dopplers. She was weaned off of O2 requirement \nand repeat Xrays were reassuring. \n\n# Heart disease with diastolic heart failure\n# Soft BP's in ED (82/43)\nOf note, Ms. ___ presented to her PCP ___ ___ for Acute\nexacerbation of heart failure and Volume overload. Her lasix was\nincreased from 80 mg daily to 80 mg BID x 1 week. She is not\nvolume overloaded (no edema on exam or pulmonary edema on CXR)\nand has ___ in setting of diarrhea and low PO intake. She \nunderwent echocardiogram which demonstrated LVEF 60% with \ngrossly normal biventricular function, however poor study \nquality. Her furosemide, metoprolol, and lisinopril were \ninitially held in the setting of hypotension and ___. Furosemide \nwas restarted at a lower dose and metoprolol was restarted in \nfractionated form. Lisinopril continued to be held.\n\n# BRBPR \n# Epigastric Pain \nAccording to PCP and to patient, patient has history of \nhemorrhoids and this is\nlikely cause of her bright red blood per rectum. Also given \nepigastric pain, there is some concern\nfor upper GI bleed or PUD. Patient has history of H. pylori\nexposure and GERD. H. Pylori stool antigen negative. Her GERD \nregimen is fairly aggressive with pantoprazole, ranitidine, and \nsucrafate. The sucrafate was transitioned to maalox. \nRecommend a discussion of downtitrating her pantoprazole in the \nsetting of\nincreased c. diff risk. \n\n# T2DM (HbA1c% 5.8 on ___\nMs. ___ diabetes has been difficult to manage in the setting\nof her ongoing diarrhea and low PO intake, she required insulin\nin the ED, but also was initiated on the hypoglycemia protocol. \nHer diarrhea started to resolve during the hospitalization and \nher blood sugars stabilized.\n\n====\n\nEmergency Contact: ___, Daughter, Phone number: \n___\nCode Status: Full Code, presumed \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

She \nconverted to normal sinus rhythm with 5mg IV Lopressor.  \nCardiology was curb sided and recommended started PO Lopressor \n25mg TID.  On POD#3, patient's Coumadin was re-started. On \nPOD#7, her Coumadin was stopped secondary to a prolonged ileus \nand concern for rising INRs. On POD#7, the patient complained of \nchest pain.  An EKG, reviewed by cardiology, revealed no acute \nchanges.  Cardiac enzymes were negative x 3. Her chest \ndiscomfort was treated with Protonix IV.  On POD#9 she had \napproximately ___ beats of VTach on telemetry with spontaneous \nresolution to normal sinus rhythm.  Electrolytes were obtained \nand repleted, EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm, and cardiac \nenzymes were negative x1.  Medicine was consulted and per their \nrecommendations, her Coumadin was restarted on POD#11 at 3mg \nqhs. She remained on telemetry for the remainder of her \nhospitalization with no additional episodes.\n\n*) GI:  The patient developed a post-operative ileus on POD#4.  \nShe initially presented with abdominal distention and nausea.  \nAn abdominal x-ray demonstrated multiple dilated loops of bowel \nand air fluid levels.

Prior to starting her chemotherapy \nwith EPOCH, a baseline echocardiogram was attained which showed \nthat she had EF of 70%.  On day #1 she received Etoposide, \ndoxorubisin, vincristine, and prednisone. On Day #5 she received \ncyclophorphamide and prednisone.  She tollerated this \nchemotherapy wothout any symptoms or side effects.  Tumor lysis \nlabs were monitored and showed no evidence of tumor lysis.  She \ndid not require any blood or platelet transfusions or have any \nfevers.  On day #6 she was discharged with instructions to start \ntaking Neupogen in 2 days and continue neupogen until her clinic \nvisit in 5 days.

She was noted to have blood pressures in \nthe 150's systolic.  She will likely need to be restarted on her \ndiuretics as an outpatient.\n.  \n# Weight gain:  The pt's weight was 132 on admission and \nsteadily increased to 156 over her relatively short admission.  \nIt was thought that the weight gain was from the aggressive \nhydration that she was receiving with chemotherapy.  However, \nshe did not show any clinical signs of overhydration - no edema, \nrhales, or elevated JVP were noted.  She was given lasix to try \nto even out her intake and output and she responded somewhat to \nit, but but she still remained 1 to 2 liters positive each day \nwhich likely contributed to her weight gain.

No left atrial \nmass/thrombus seen (best excluded by transesophageal \nechocardiography). The right atrium is moderately dilated. No \natrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler or saline at \nrest. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left \nventricular cavity is moderately dilated with mild global \nhypokinesis (LVEF = 46%). Systolic function of apical segments \nis relatively preserved. Right ventricular chamber size is \nnormal with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic \nvalve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is \nnot present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve \nleaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve \nprolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is \nborderline pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no \npericardial effusion. \n\n IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity dilation with mild global \nhypokinesis in a pattern suggestive of a ___ \ncardiomyopathy. Mild mitral regurgitation. Borderline pulmonary \nartery systolic hypertension. No resting ___ \nintracardiac shunt identified. \n\n CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: \n Based on ___ AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the \necho findings indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical \ndecisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on \nclinical and echocardiographic data.  \n\nCT Chest \nFindings suggest pneumonia (has the appearance of resolving \npneumonia) most marked in the lung bases.  Due to this \ndistribution aspiration pneumonia should be excluded. \n  \nHyperdense appearance of the liver: Is this patient on \namiodarone?

The cardiac silhouette is at the upper \nlimits of normal in size or mildly enlarged and there is \nindistinctness of engorged pulmonary vessels consistent with \nelevated pulmonary venous pressure. Prominence of central \npulmonary vessels is consistent with the clinical diagnosis of \npulmonary arterial hypertension. \nThere is more focal opacification at the right base which, in \nthe appropriate clinical setting would be worrisome for \naspiration/pneumonia. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ M with Afib on Coumadin, ?COPD (smoking history 40 pack \nyears; and environmental exposure), systolic CHF (last EF \n___, ?severe pulmonary hypertension, CKD (baseline Cr 1.3) \nadmitted to ___ CCU for persistent hypoxia requiring BiPAP, \nwho was transferred to ___ for workup of persistent hypoxia, \nthought to be secondary to COPD exacerbation with underlying \nvolume overload, improved with COPD exacerbation treatment and \nIV diuresis.\n\n#Hypoxia, acute respiratory failure: Prior to transfer, at \n___, cardiac cath with elevated mPAP to 32.

At BI started on \nprednisone 60mg for COPD exacerbation, given azithromycin course \nand gentle diuresis. He slowly improved with O2 requirement down \nfrom high flow NC to 5L on room air. Of note, he had a repeat \nTTE which showed improvement in LVEF to 45% after diuresis. He \nhad a CT chest which showed probable resolving pneumonia, trace \ncentrilobular emphysema and hyperdense appearance of liver \nthought consistent with known prior amiodarone toxicity. It was \noverall thought that his hypoxia was related to interstitial \nedema from decompensated CHF and underlying emphysema. Patient \nwas diuresed with IV Lasix and continued a Prednisone taper, and \nhe improved from high flow O2 to RA. \n  \n#?Pulmonary HTN: Sildenafil trialed at OSH, though on review the \ncardiac cath which showed elevated pulmonary pressures was \nperformed when patient was significant volume overloaded. As it \nwas felt that pulm hypertension unlikely playing a significant \nrole in this patient's hypoxic episode, sildenafil was stopped. \nHIV and ___ were negative. Patient should have pulmonary follow \nup and further work up now that he is euvolemic.\n\n#?COPD: Patient does not carry this diagnosis, however he never \nhad PCP follow up until recently.

He was significantly diuresed at ___ and at \n___. Metoprolol held initially in setting of decompensated HF, \nand then restarted Metoprolol and Lisinopril. Patient was also \nstarted on aspirin 81 mg daily.\n\n#Afib: Chads2vasc score of 2. He was continued on digoxin in \nhouse, as well as warfarin. Metoprolol continued at discharge.\n \n___ on CKD: Cr 1.8, baseline 1.3. This improved with diuresis, \nand so likely cardiorenal. Back to baseline of ___ on discharge.\n\n#Urethral stricture: Pt has required dilation by urology in past \nfor foley placement. Foley was placed on ___ by urology at \n___ for retention.

CTA of head and neck was done and did not show any \ndissection. MRI of the head did show evidence of new and old \nstrokes, so further work up for etiology of the stroke was done. \nHis TTE did not show any cardiac source of embolism, but TEE \nshowed a small patent foramen ovale. His other risk factors such \nas A1C and lipid panel were within normal limits. Ultrasound of \nhis legs were done and did not show any deep vein thrombosis. \nHypercoagulable studies were sent off during this \nhospitalization, and some of the studies are still pending at \nthe time of discharge.\n\n# Neuro: CTA without dissection or stenosis, MRI with acute \nstrokes in right frontal/parietal lobe; it also shows possible \nold strokes. He was allowed to autoregulate his BP and monitored \non telemetry without events. His lipid panel showed HDL 66, LDL \n89, Triglyceride 49. A1C 5.4%. TTE did not show a source of \ncardiac embolus but TEE did show a small PFO. Given patient's \nyoung age and no obvious risk factors, hypercoagulable work up \nwas done and was negative for ___ and lupus anticoagulants, but \nthese studies are still pending: Antithrombin III, protein C, \nprotein S, Anticardiolipin IgM and IgG, homocysteine and \nbeta-glycoprotein. Ultrasound of bilateral legs were done to \nrule out deep vein thrombosis which could embolize to brain \nthrough PFO, but were negative for blood clots. Patient was \nstarted on full dose aspirin during this hospitalization to \ndecrease risk of recurrent stroke.\n\n# CV: His troponin was negative on admission, and pt was \nmonitored on telemetry without events. Blood pressure was \nallowed to autoregulate. As his lipid panel was wnl, he was not \nstarted on any statins. TTE/TEE showed normal cardiac function. \n\n# Allergies: seasonal allergies, continued on home zyrtec. \n\n# FEN: pt passed bedside swallow eval, started on heart \nhealthy/low sodium diet (at patient's request). \n\n# PPx: \n- DVT: for DVT prophylaxis, heparin SQ TID ordered and offered \nwith explanation about importance of DVT prophylaxis in the \nhospital, but patient refused. Patient was encouraged to \nambulate throughout the day to minimize the risk of DVT. \nPneumoboots were ordered for when in bed.\n- bowel regimen\n\n# Code: Full\n \nMedications on Admission:\nPreadmission medications listed are correct and complete.  \nInformation was obtained from Patient.\n1. ZYRtec *NF* 10 mg Oral daily \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. ZYRtec *NF* 10 mg Oral daily \n2. Aspirin 325 mg PO DAILY \n\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nHome\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary Diagnosis: cryptogenic stroke\n\n \nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.\nNeurologic Status: anisocoria L\u003eR, otherwise normal cranial \nnerves, strength, sensation and coordination.\n \nDischarge Instructions:\nDear Mr. ___,\nIt was a pleasure to take care of you at ___ \n___. You were transferred from ___ for \nyour left facial droop, dysarthria (slurred speech) and \nnumbness/weakness of your left hand. There was a concern for \ndissection of vessels in your neck given your recent \nwakeboarding/trauma, but CT angiography of your neck vessels did \nnot show any dissection. \n\nMRI of your brain showed that you did have a very recent stroke, \nand likely also had an old one. Given these findings, we looked \nfor source of stroke with ultrasound of your heart, and the \ntransoesophageal echocardiogram showed a patent foramen ovale \n(PFO). Ultrasound of your legs was done to see if there was any \nblood clots, but it did not show any. Laboratory studies for \nhypercoagulability (increased risk of blood clotting) was sent \noff, some of them came back negative, but others are still \npending and will need to be followed up on. \n\nYou were started on full dose aspirin for prevention of further \nstrokes. \n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"}

She \npresented from clinic with hyponatremia likely ___ \noxcarbazepine. \n\nACUTE ISSUES:\n===============\n#Hypoosmolar Hyponatremia \nUrine electrolytes were consistent with SIADH, likely secondary \nto oxcarbazepine up-titration. The oxcarbazepine was stopped. \nShe was kept on a fluid restriction, and serum sodium slowly \ncorrected to within normal limits. She was given intermittent \nD5W blouse to prevent overly rapid correction. TSH and AM \ncortisol were within normal limits. \nDischarge sodium: 138, stable for \u003e 36 hours\n\n#Trigeminal neuralgia v. subacute VZV\nPatient developed facial pain following left V1, V2 distribution \nof zoster opthalmicus. This was diagnosed by her outpatient \nneurologist as trigeminal neuralgia. Given the time frame of \nabout 4 weeks after VZV, subacute VZV is also on the \ndifferential diagnosis. Her oxcarbazepine was stopped. Pain \nservice was consulted, and per their recommendations, she was \nstarted on Baclofen 5mg TID and her Gabapentin was increased to \n600mg TID.  \n\n#Toxic Metabolic Encephalopathy\nPatient presented with slow thought and unsteady gait, likely \nsecondary to hyponatremia. During admission, she remained fully \noriented and alert. However, per her husband, she continued to \nhave slow speech and thought process even after her sodium had \ncorrected to within normal limits. This may have been secondary \nto up-titrating gabapentin. She also expressed anxiety about \nunpredictable pain and the effect they might have on her work, \nso depressed mood in the setting of new diagnosis and \nunpredictable pain may also contribute to slowed thinking. She \nwas evaluated by neurology who noted that these memory problems \nhave been ongoing for at least a year. She did well on all \nneurocognitive testing, so there was low concern for \nneurodegenerative disease. They felt she was safe for outpatient \nneurology follow-up.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n========================\n Medications: \n[] Oxcarbazepine was discontinued.\n[] Gabapentin was up-titrated to 600mg TID.\n[] Please monitor mental status, and consider down-titrating or \nstopping gabapentin if concern for ongoing altered mental \nstatus.\n[] Baclofen 5mg TID was started. Consider uptitrating as \nappropriate.\n[] TCAs were avoided for now given this episode of hyponatremia, \nhowever if above neuropathic agents are optimized in dosing and \ndo not provide adequate benefit, could consider adding Cymbalta.\n[] topical Lidocaine started\n[] Please assess for improvement in episodes of pain, and \nwhether medications can be tapered off\n \nFollow-up: \n[] Patient needs follow up with PCP ___ ___ weeks.\n[] Patient needs follow up with neurology in ___ weeks.\n[] Patient will need repeat Chem 10 in 1 week. \n[] Please follow up patient's mood and provide support as needed \ngiven patient's concerns about her pain affecting her job.\n\nCode Status: Full (confirmed)\nEmergency contact: ___ (Husband) - ___\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Her leukocytosis was slightly \nincongruent was this and was thought to be related to \ncellulitis. Of note, although the patient presented with low \nblood pressures, she was always stable and even after she was \nafebrile had systolics in the ___ and low 100s. LP was done out \nof concern for neck pain with fevers but was negative. C.diff \nwas negative and Blood Cultures are negative to date on \ndischarge (final pending.) Given concern for infection in the \nsetting of asplenia, she was initially treated with Vancomycin, \nZosyn and Clindamycin per ID recommendations. However, as her \nfever improved, her antibiotics regimen was narrowed to \nVancomycin; she was discharged on 10 days of IV Vancomycin, with \nPICC for cellulitis (see below.) Her pain was treated with \nTylenol, Ibuprofen and Ultram. \n.\n# L arm cellulitis: Ms. ___ had extensive R arm cellulitis that \nspread outside of previously marked borders over her first day \nof stay but improved on Vanc/Zosyn/Clindamycin, and continued to \nimprove when she was narrowed to Vanc. The nidus of infection \nwas thought to be her vaccination. Extensive imaging was done \n(see result section) to look for gas or abscess, but was all \nnegative. The cellulitis was thought to be secondary to seeding \nat the vaccination site. As described above, she was initially \ntreated with Vanc, Zosyn, Clinda but this was narrowed to Vanc \nalone for discharge.   \n.  \n# Hyponatriemia: The patient was initially hyponatremic in the \nsetting of hypovolemia; this resolved with fluid repletion. \n.  \n# Transaminitis: The patient had a mild transaminitis in the \nsetting of some mild epigastric pain. A RUQ U/S was negative. \nThese elevated markers were thought to be due to muscle \ninflammation secondary to her cellulitis; they downtrended prior \nto discharge. \n \nMedications on Admission:\nibuprofen 600-800mg TID prn  \nlevofloxacin 750mg daily (Rx ___ with vaccines in case of \nfever, patient never took this)  \nimitrex ___ prn migraine  \n \nDischarge Medications:\n1. ibuprofen 400 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q8H (every 8 \nhours) as needed for pain/fever.\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n2. tramadol 50 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Q4H (every 4 \nhours) as needed for pain.\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n3. vancomycin in D5W 1 gram/200 mL Piggyback Sig: One (1) GM \nIntravenous Q 12H (Every 12 Hours) for 10 days: Last dose \n___.\nDisp:*20 grams* Refills:*0*\n4.

Clinical \npicture was consistent with acute limb ischemia from what \nimaging shows to be complete bilateral proximal artery \nocclusions with reconstitution in the profunda. Symptoms \nslightly improved on\nsystemic anticoagulation but required immediate surgical \nintervention to prevent limb loss.\n\nShe was taken to the operating room on ___ for a bilat \nthrombectomy, angio, R EIA stent, L CIA/EIA stent. Her \nintraoperative course was remarkable for formation of fresh \nthrombi intra-operatively, that could be evacuated. Further, her \nEBL was 1200 and she received IVF 6L and 3u pRBC. For full \ndetails, please see the operative report.  She was transferred \nto the ICU post-op intubated. She was extubated on POD#1 without \nissues. Postoperatively, she developed HIT in response to the \nheparin she had received perioperatively. Her heparin gtt was \nstopped and an argatroban gtt was ordered. Her PF4 Heparin \nAntibodies and SRA assay were positive, confirming HIT. \nHematology was consulted and recommended either Coumadin for \nlife or dual anti-platelet therapy. Due to her anaphylactic \nreaction to Plavix, she will either have to undergo Plavix \ndesensitization in the ICU, or can test Ticagrelor, which should \nnot have cross- reactivity (but case reports of cross- \nreactivity exist). \n\nShe was transferred to the VICU on ___. She developed a \ntemperature of ___ on ___ and was started on a short \ncourse of Bactrim. Bactrim was stopped on ___, as she was \nno longer febrile and there were no other signs of erythema or \ninfection. Bilateral JP drains were pulled on ___. The left \ndrain incision had serous output, and 3 stitches were placed on \n___. However, the incision continued to have serous output \n(~200cc/d). \n\nOn POD#3, she was 5kg up from her baseline weight. Due to low \nblood pressure (90s/60s), she was not diuresed with Lasix until \nPOD#5. She responded well.\n\nOn ___, her platelet count was \u003e150, so she was started on \n2.5mg of Coumadin.\n\n Post-operatively, she did well without significant incisional \nswelling and no evidence of hemodynamic instability. She \nexperienced afib with RVE, refractory to rate control \nmedications, and was started on amiodarone drip. THis was \ntransitioned to PO amiodarone over time. She was seen by \ncardiology, who recommended starting her on Coumadin for her new \ndiagnosis of refractory afib. She will be discharged home on \nCoumadin with close vascular surgery and cardiology follow up. \nShe will have ___ services for close monitoring of INR. At the \ntime of discharge, she was doing well, afebrile with stable \nvital signs. She was tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, \nvoiding without assistance, and her pain was well controlled on \noral medications.

During that \nadmission, Na improved without intervention with good PO intake. \nNow admitted for sodium of 120. She was started on NS \n@150cc/hour in the ED. On presentation, patient was hypovolemic \nto euvolemic on physical exam, with known decreased PO intake. \nShe also has chronic pain. Serum osm of 252 confirms a hypotonic \nhyponatremia. Urine Na 40, FeNa 0.8%, urine osm 242. Ddx broad \nbut includes mineralocorticoid deficiency, renal tubular \nacidosis or poor PO intake (\"tea and toast\") if truly \nhypovolemic, and SIADH, hypothyroidism and glucocorticoid \ndeficiency if truly euvolemic. Na increased to 125 after fluids. \nTSH was found to be normal at 0.82. Patient was placed on 1200 \ncc/day fluid restriction and sodium corrected to 130 by the end \nof hospitalization. Ms. ___ was sent home with ___ services for \nweekly sodium monitoring. \n    \n# Lethargy/Weakness: Patient reportedly less responsive this \nmorning but alert and responsive upon evaluation. No focal \nneurological deficits to suggest evolving stroke. Likely \nsecondary to hyponatremia and suboptimal PO intake. As sodium \nand PO intake improved, patient was noted by family to return to \nher baseline level of mentation.\n \n# Chest pain: Patient without known CAD and with a history of \nsubsternal chest pain ___ GERD. GERD is likely etiology. In an \nelderly woman with poorly-controlled HTN and evidence of LVH on \nEKG and cardiomegaly on CXR, cardiac etiology was a concern but \nruled out with normal EKG, negative serial troponins, and ECHO \ndemonstrating symmetric LVH, EF of 70%. Home omeprazole was \ncontinued without resolution of pain. GI was consulted. Barium \nswallow showed evidence of esophageal dysmotility. EGD was \nnegative for stricture or obstruction and a deep esophageal \nbiopsy was taken. There is no plan for manometry as patient may \nnot tolerate the procedure, though GI suspects she may have \nearly achalasia and recommends soft dysphagia diet for treament \nof pain. If pain or symptoms progress, patient may consider \nbotox injections down the road. \n\n# HTN: BP 180s on admission, although usually 130-150s at home. \nPatient is asymptomatic. We continued her home atenolol 25 mg \nBID throughout the hospitalization and held her home lisinopril \ndue to hyponatremia. She had occasional SBPs in the 170s-190s, \nthough remained asymptomatic. By discharge, her SBPs were in the \n140s-160s for over 24 hours.  \n\n# Chronic shoulder/back pain: Secondary to cervical and lumbar \nstenosis. Patient not on chronic pain medications at home, \nalthough pain responsive to Tylenol. Her pain was managed with \nTylenol ___ mg TID thoughout her hospital stay. \n\n# GERD: She remained on home dose omeprazole without resolution \nof her chest pain. \n \n# Dementia: Reported by daughter to have memory issues in past \n___ years, not on any medications \n\n# Constipation: A chronic problem. Improves with Miralax, \nmetamucil and suppositories. Per patient's daughter, ___ \nhas improved with hospital bowel regimen, meeting or exceeding \ngoal of 1 bowel movement per day. She was sent home with a \nprescription for miralax and docusate sodium.\n\n#Nutrition: Patient's sodium levels are thought to be due to \nSIADH and a \"tea and toast\" poor PO intake also due to dysphagia \nand chest pain now thought to be due to esophageal dysfunction. \nPatient was transitioned to soft dysphagia diet and was \nprescribed ensure TID to supplement nutritional needs. \n\nTransitional issues:\n[ ] weekly BMP and blood pressure monitoring by ___\n[ ] follow-up esophageal biopsy from ___ EGD\n[ ] monitor BP consider holding lisinopril if BP decreases\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

Cardiac cath and stent placement to \nLAD, RCA, CXA on ___, with course complicated by contrast \ninduced nephropathy (___) and small stable pseudoaneurysm. \n\nActive Diagnoses:\n#Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure:  Pt with prior EF 65% \npresented initially to OSH chest-pain free, with worsening SOB, \nclinical signs of fluid overload and CXR with pulmonary edema \nconsistent with acute CHF.  Troponins and BNP were elevated.  \nEKG with nonspecific T wave changes.  Pt started on statin, ASA \nand LasiX IV bolus diuresis.  Diagnostic cath revealed 3VD, but \nshe was not a surgical candidate for CABG.  On ___, PCI with \nDES to RCA, LAD, and LCX.  ECHO showed preserved EF with severe \naortic stenosis suggesting demand ischemia may have triggered \nthe acute CHF.  After achieving euvolemia, her course was \ncomplicated by contrast-induced nephropathy which required \nfluids/PRBC that resulted in a second episode of fluid overload \nand subsequent diuresis which she tolerated well.  Pt was \ndischarged at a dry weight of 64.5kg which is 142.2 lbs.  Her \nhome dose of lasix was increased on discharge.\n.\n#Coronary Artery Disease: Pt presented with chest-pain free SOB, \npositive trops and EKG with non-specific T wave changes \nsuggestive of NSTEMI vs demand ischemia. Pt placed on heparin \ngtt. Diagnostic cath showed 3 vessel disease, but she was not a \ncandidate for CABG due to heavily calcified aorta.  On ___ PCI \nof ___. Pt started on Aspirin and Plavix.\n.\n# Aortic Stenosis: In the setting of acute diastolic HF, pt \nfound to have tight AS with ___ 0.9 cm2 and high restrictive \nindicies. She was not a candidate for AVR given calcification of \nher aorta.  However, she is currently being evaluated by  Dr. \n___ the possibility of future aortic valvuloplasty or \npercutaneous valve replacement as part of the ___ trial.  \nShe is scheduled to follow up with Dr. ___ as an outpatient.  \n.\n# Chronic Atrial Fibrillation:  Pt presented in sinus rhythm, \nbut with history of  afib on coumadin (CHADS score=6).  Her BB \nwas changed from Atenolol to Metoprolol daily.  On admission she \nhad a supratherapeutic INR requiring Vitamin K.  She was \nrestarted on Coumadin after the ___ cath without bridging, and \ndischarged with a therapeutic INR (___).  Dr. ___ PCP, \n___ continue to follow INRs on an outpatient basis.\n\n# Contrast-Induced Nephropathy ___ on CKD): Pt with baseline  \nCr of 1.6-7.  After second cardiac cath, blood work revealed \n___, with a Cr from 1.6 to 3.3.  Likely secondary to contrast \ninduced nephropathy.  Cr downtrended after receiving 1unit PRBC \nand gentle hydration. She continued to have adequate urine \noutput.  She was discharged with Cr 2.4.  Her Losartan was held \nin light of this ___. Changed her Atenolol to Metoprolol given \nher renal dysfunction. The plan is for PCP/Cardiology to \nconsider restarting losartan if her Creatinine returns to her \nbaseline of 1.6-7.  \n.\n#RCFA pseudoaneurysm:  Cardiac cath with right common femoral \nartery access complicated by failure of EXOSEAL to deploy \ncorrectly.  Pt was found to have a hematoma with pseudoaneurysm \n(8mm) that remained stable for the remainder of the hospital \ncourse.  Her hematocrit was slightly downtrending.  Possibly \nsuggestive of numerous blood draws, rather than frank anemia.  \nWill be re-imaged (US) and reevaluated in ___ weeks. This is to \nbe arranged by her PCP or ___.\n.\n# Lung nodules: Incidental finding on CT chest.  Requires CT \nfollow-up in 6 - 12 months if clinically indicated.\n.  \nChronic Diagnoses:\n# DM:  Pt's sugars were loosely controlled in the hospital with \nBS into the 300s at night likely representative of stress \nresponse to cardiac cath x2.  Her glipizide was held given the \nmultiple caths and subsequent ___.  She was controlled on a \nloose SSI.  Requires close PCP monitoring of ___ on an \noutpatient basis.  Patient counseled on need to follow BS \nclosely on discharge.  \n.\n# HTN: Stable, SBPs to 140s. Continued amlodipine 10 mg. \nAdministered clonodine as po rather than her home patch.  Pt to \nplace patch the morning after discharge. Changed Atenolol to \nMetoprolol because of atenolol's renal clearance. Held losartan \nin light ___ on CKD.  PCP/Cardiology can restart the losartan \nif Cr resolves to her baseline (1.6-7).\n.\n# HL: Stable, Switched to atorvastatin given FDA warning of \nAmlodipine and simvastatin.\n.\n# Gout:  Stable, continued allopurinol.\n.\n# Hypothyroid: Stable, continued levothyroxine.\n.\n# Glaucoma:  Stable, continued timolol.\n.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n-5 mm apical lung nodules seen on CT chest, f/u w/ repeat CT in \n___ months if clinically indicated.\n-Pt found to have elevated BS to the 300s during this admission \nin the setting of holding her oral meds.  Likely due to stress \nresponse related to cardiac catheterization.

A overlying 2.0 cm \nregular \nopacification along the right hepatic lobe may be extension of \nsoft tissue \nfrom the gallbladder.  Findings are suspicious, recommend \nnonurgent right \nupper quadrant ultrasound or MR for further evaluation. \n7. Perineum was not fully imaged. \n\nIMPRESSION: \n  \n  \n1. Within the left groin, as the groin crease reaches the \nperineum, there is \nan area of soft tissue stranding and thickening measuring \napproximately 5.8 x \n2.5 cm.  A few small foci of gas are within this region (series \n2, image 37). \nThis may represent gas within the wound or trapped air within \nthe groin \ncrease. \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. ___ is a ___ with no known pmhx and was found down by \nfamily today and presented to an OSH in sepsis. She was \ntransferred to ___ for further evaluation and is being \nadmitted to the ___ for c/f septic shock and altered mental \nstatus.\n\n# Sepsis concern\n# Skin and soft tissue infection: R chest wall mass seen by \nbreast surgery in ED, who felt not likely to be source of \nsepsis. \n# C/f necrotizing fasciitis: CT pelvis with area of soft tissue \nstranding with gas collection in L. groin as groin crease \nreaches perineum (5.8x2.5cm).\n# UTI: U/A c/f UTI\n# R. hepatic nodule \nPatient presents with elevated lactate and metabolic acidosis \nwith multiple concerning infectious sources. Notably she has \nseveral skin lesions on R chest wall, R axilla, and L groin. She \nhas an overlying 2.0 cm of irregular opacification in the right \nhepatic lobe which was indeterminate. She has blood and urine \ncultures which were drawn on admission, and she is being broadly \ncovered with IV vancomycin, zosyn, and clindamycin. Surgery team \ndid not feel that surgical intervention was indicated. Her \nlactate trended down with fluids from 4.1 on admission to 2.8 on \n___ AM. Although an ongoing issue is to follow up with \nradiology to better characterize the hepatic lesion, this \nultimately may not be within the patient's goals of care. \n\n# Right chest wall mass: \n# Left axillary masses: \nPatient was found to have right chest wall mass extending into \naxilla (14.4x13.1cm) with exophytic mass over R. breast, along \nwith multiple axillary, anterior chest wall, R. supraclavicular \nmasses concerning for inflammatory breast cancer. She also has \nL. axillary masses c/f metastatic disease. Breast surgery was \nconsulted for possibility of bedside core biopsy. Patient's \nfamily has determined that this would ultimately be within their \ngoals even if only for diagnostic purposes. Her imaging and \npresentation is most consistent with metastatic breast cancer; \nthere is no acute indication for debridement of the chest would \nper surgery and her family feels that palliative chemotherapy \nwould not be within goals of care. Following breast biopsy, they \nwould consider transitioning to comfort measures only.\n\n#DVT/PE\nOn presentation had CT torso with DVT and PE. She was maintained \non heparin drip with normal oxygen saturations.\n\n#Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis\n#Lactic Acidosis               \nPresented with 7.___, HCO3 7, AG 36. Appears to be improving \ns/p IVF. Likely ___ elevated lactate (4.1) at admission. ___ \nalso have some component of renal failure vs. uremia, but \nunclear since her medical history is largely unknown to us at \nthis time. Less likely DKA, as blood sugars have been wnl. \nLactate is downtrending with fluids.\n\n___\nCr 1.9 at admission, though unclear what patient's baseline Cr \nis. Per family, she has been increasingly oliguric over the last \nthree months. She received over 6L fluids at OSH and in the ED. \nHer creatinine has been stable at 1.8.\n\n# Encephalopathy\n# Altered mental status\nPatient is not oriented to person, place, or time. There may be \nsome contribution of infection to her mental status. She \nreceived olanzapine in the ED but otherwise has no received \nsignificant sedating pain medications. There is a possibility \nthat she has metastatic disease to the brain; family requests an \nMRI.\n\n#Social Issues\nReportedly estranged from family members until recently. Unclear \nwhat her supports are. SW consulted in the ED. Notified family \nand sister ___ is at bed side.\n\n#Poor IV ___\nRN tried multiple times to get access, pt is difficult to draw \nlabs from. Unable to place PICC or midline due to extensive \naxillary masses.\n\nGOALS OF CARE:\nAfter reviewing her clinical course in the ICU, the family met \nwith the ICU team.  The decision was made to transition the \npatient to comfort measures only.  All medications were stopped \nother than for comfort.  There were no more lab draws or vital \nsigns.  Season's hospice was consulted and the patient was \ntransferred to home with hospice care.  She is DNR/DNI/DNH going \nforward.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nNone\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

The patient was started on IV vancomycin \nand cefepime for broad spectrum coverage, and treated with IV \ndilaudid for pain control. She underwent an anterior and \nposterior approach epidural abscess drainage and L5-S1 vertebral \nbody washout with the installation of hardware for structural \nsupport. Cultures were drawn intraoperatively which grew Staph \nAureus, matching the blood cultures from the OSH. With this \ndata, cefepime was discontinued, and the patient was continued \non Vancomycin for coverage of both MSSA and MRSA. The cultures \neventually spectated to MRSA and the patient was continued on \nvancomycin. \n\nFor pain control post operatively, the acute pain service was \nconsulted who managed a ketamine drip for 48 hours. In addition, \nthe pt was given a Dilaudid PCA, Acetaminophen 1000mg, and \nGabapentin 600mg. When the pain was better controlled, the \npatient was started on an oral regimen, with IV dilaudid PRN. \nThe patient also developed an acute on chronic anemia, with a \nhemoglobin of 6.4, for which she was transfused one unit of \npRBCs. The patient continued to have pain control issues and was \nmaintain on IV and PO dilaudid. On ___, the patient continued \nto spike fevers. A CT abdomen/ pelvis was done, which showed a  \nnew 4 cm fluid collection with peripheral enhancement and \nstranding medial to the bifurcation of the left common iliac \nartery, worrisome for infection. On ___, ___ placed drains in and \ndrained a superior, inferior, and abdominal collection. \n\nThe patient then had resolution of her fevers, but worsening \npain. Chronic pain was consulted and her regimen was changed to \nMorphine ___ 15mg q4h and her none opioid medications were \noptimized. Patient was seen by social work for discussion of \nlong term treatment plans of Opioid Use disorder. The patient \npreferred suboxone and on ___ her opioids and diazepam were \nstopped. On ___ when the patient's ___ was 8, the patient \nreceived one 4mg dose of suboxone around noon. Soon after she \nbecame anxious and stated she wanted to leave AMA. Infectious \ndisease, the ___ medicine attending, and social work spoke \nto the patient extensively about the risks of leaving AMA, \nincluding the danger of leaving with an incomplete treatment of \ndiscitis/osteomyelitis, particularly in the setting of having \nhardware in place. Patient still decided to leave AMA after \nhearing all the risks of leaving, including death and worsening \ninfections. Patient was redosed on her suboxone to 10mg total. \nShe watched a video and was counseled on clean injection \ntechniques and Naloxone use. Her PICC line was pulled and she \nwas given a script for one month of Rifampin 300mg BID, bactrim \nDS 2 tabs BID, and naloxone and told to come for ID follow-up. \nAlso encouraged to immediately report to the ER at ___ \n___ for any serious problems.\n\n#) Epidural abscess  \n#) Discitis/osteomyelitis  \nThe patient has a history of active IVDU, and presented with \nback pain, found to have L5/S1 discitis/osteomyelitis with \nassociated epidural abscess associated with compression of the \ncauda equina nerve roots. Imaging also demonstrated an \nassociated right paravertebral abscess and small presacral \nabscesses. She was started on vancomycin and cefepime for \nempiric coverage, and underwent an anterior and posterior \napproach, L5 vertebral body washout and spidural abscess \ndrainage. Pt continued to have reassuring neuro exam throughout \nher preoperative and postoperative course, never demonstrating \nevidence of cauda equina syndrome. OSH blood cultures were found \nto  staph aureus, which matched the intraoperative cultures \ntaken. Per ID recs, antibiotic therapy was narrowed to \nVancomycin alone for MSSA and MRSA coverage until speciation.  \nBlood culture from ___ grew MRSA. ID followed with \nthe patient and planned to continue IV vancomycin for 6 weeks. \nAlso added rifampin on ___ for synergy in regimen. On ___ \npatient chose to leave AMA and her PICC line was pulled. ID \nrecommended Bactrim DS 2 tablets BID and rifampin 300mg BID, \nalong with follow-up in ___ clinic.\n\n#Post operative pain: Pt in severe post op pain, with the acute \npain service following. She was originally on a ketamine drip \n(managed by ___), Acetaminophen 1000 mg PO/NG Q6H, Diazepam 5 mg \nPO/NG Q6H:PRN muscle spasm/anxiety, Gabapentin 600 mg PO/NG TID, \nand hydromorphone (Dilaudid) 0.36 mg IVPCA. When pain was well \ncontrolled, this regimen was deescalated to PO dilaudid with IV \ndilaudid for breakthrough pain. Pt was also having abdominal \npain post operatively, with concern for both post op ileus as \nwell as opiate induced constipation. KUB was not concerning, and \npt was treated with an aggressive bowel regimen, and \nmethylnaltrexone. The regimen was transitioned to Morphine 15mg \nq4h for pain and non-opioid treatment was optimized. Patient \nthen had withdrawal of opioid and benzodiazepine the medication \non ___ for the preparation of suboxone treatment on ___. \nPatient left AMA without prescriptions for pain medication.\n\n#)Intraabdominal collection-\nPatient continued to have fevers after surgery, so was taken by \n___ for a drainage and drain placement on ___. Fever defervesced. \nA repeat CT scan showed improvement of the lateral collections, \nbut persistence of the largest collection. No repeat imagining \nwas recommended at that time, unless the patient continued to \nhave fevers.\n\n#) Anemia  \nPt’s baseline Hgb ___, previously thought to be secondary to \niron and B12 deficiency. On admission, the pt’s Hgb was 6.9 and \nnormocytic. Hgb dropped to 6.4 during hospitalization with no \nsigns of active bleeding, and no evidence of hemolysis. Pt was \ntransfused one unit of pRBCs with a good response. Continued to \nhave low hg, but stable. Work up included testing for hemolysis \nand iron studies which were unrevealing. Thought to be \nmultifactorial, including nutritional and secondary to \ninflammation.\n\n#) Opiate use disorder: The patient was seen by the addiction \nspecialist several times throughout the hospital stay who \nrecommended continuously assessed the patient's readiness to \nstart long term OUD treatment. Patient preferred suboxone to \nmethadone, though had previously tried both and relapsed. The \npatient was nervous to start treatment, but stated \"it has to \nget hard before it gets easier.\" On ___, morphine and valium \nwas stopped and suboxone was initiated the next AM. Patient \nreceived 4mg, then 2mg more for ongoing withdrawal symptoms \nbefore leaving AMA. Was offered symptomatic medications, but did \nnot want them. Was counseled on safe needle practices, naloxone \nuse, and  The patient was educated on potential places to get \nsuboxone and where to get needles. The patient stated she hoped \nto abstain from further drug use of heroine and cocaine, but \nfelt that she was likely to relapse. \n\n#) Hydronephrosis- Patient was found to have hydronephrosis on \nCT scan. Her creatinine and urine function remained stable.\n\n# Hyperphosphotemia: Rising during the admission without clear \ncause.  No evidence of hemolysis, muscle breakdown.  Pt left AMA \nbefore monitoring and workup was complete.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\n- Pt left AMA despite team insistence and her ability to \nunderstand the risks.

Her work up at OSH was reportedly negative with \nnormal head CT and reassuring CSF. Despite low suspicion, we \nhave asked the OSH to also add MS panel to CSF studies, will \nfollow up this result.\nHer neurologic examination was complicated by pain but she \nclearly as peripheral L facial nerve palsy and she has sustained \nnystagmus without clear eye movement abnormality or new \ndiplopia. She did describe triple vision on history, which is \ndifficult to explain from brainstem lesion. The sensory \nexamination was unfortunately mixed and does not assist much in \nlocalization. Her motor exam in the upper extremities was \nreassuring, though it was difficult to test for long tract signs \nin lower extremities given her effort. Her gait examination \nshows some functional component with significant swaying without \nactually falling and perhaps some improvement with distraction. \nAdmission focused on exluding dangerous causes of repeated \nepisodes of facial droop and vertigo. CT scan of the ___ was \ndone (with contrast) and reported as normal (neurology's review \nwas also normal). CTA was also performed to assess for any \nvascular malformation, ischemic lesions, or other vascular \ncauses that may explain her symptoms. CTA was also reported as \nnormal. With these results as well as a normal CSF profile at \nOSH, we plan to discharge to rehab. \nPresumptive diagnosis is left Bell's palsy with ___ nerve \nirritation as well. Alternative diagnoses were considered: mass \nlesion (evaluated w imaging), vascular lesion (evaluated w CTA), \nCNS infection (imaging, CSF), multiple sclerosis (CSF studies \npending; though note that though lesions are separated in time, \nthey are not separated in space), and atypical migraine (the \npatient currently reports a headache but has no prior headache \nhistory).\nMs. ___ was started on prednisone 40mg at OSH.

Hospital course was complicated by oliguric \nrenal failure in setting of contrast load on ___ and NSAID \nuse, and hypotension in setting of receiving entresto and \ndiuresis, requiring transfer to the MICU for worsening hypoxia \nand persistent hypotension. He was found to have R side pleural \neffusion with improvement after chest tube placement x2 ___, \nremoved, replaced ___. Further hospital course complicated by \nC difficile.  \n\nACUTE ISSUES:\n=============\n#Hypoxemia  \n#Right pleural effusion\n#Concern for RLL PNA\n#Trapped lung\nOn arrive to ED at ___, pt noted to be developing progressive \nhypoxemia requiring nasal cannula in setting of developing \noliguric renal failure. Suspected multifactorial due to PNA, \npleural effusion, \u0026 pulmonary edema from volume overload. \nEffusion likely chronic per review of imaging, and potentially \nhas formed fibrosis causing trapped lung. s/p R side chest tube \n___, which was removed same day after minimal draining, \nreplaced ___ for reaccumulation and quickly removed again. CT \nchest ___ also indicated possible atypical PNA, completed 7 day \ncourse of cefepime for HAP (___), transitioned briefly to \nceftriaxone/azithro (___). He was also found to have e/o \nvolume overload in setting of diuretic held and receiving IVF \nfor hypotension. Hypoxia improved somewhat with gentle diuresis, \nand home Lasix was restarted three days prior to discharge with \nstable volume status and oxygen requirement. At time of \ndischarge, he is still requiring oxygen although has decreased \nfrom 4L to 1.5-2L. Likely will remain dependent on oxygen until \ndecortication after rehab. Eventual plan is to likely \ndecortication per IP, who will follow outpt with patient in 4 \nweeks, when he will also receive a chest CT. \n\n#Hypotension \n#History of Hypertension\nInitially suspected PNA \u0026 Entresto use I/s/o sepsis. Entresto \nand diuretics were held. Per nephrology, sacubitril's inhibition \nof neprilysin leads to increase in several vasoactive substances \nincluding BNP and bradykinin which are vasodilators, and likely \nculprits for what appears to be his prior distributive \nhypotension. Metoprolol succinate home dose is 225 mg; he was \nswitched to metoprolol succinate 50mg daily with good blood \npressure and HR control. BP remained stable 99-103/62-70 since \n___. Discussed ___ meds with outpatient cardiologist \nDr. ___ requested that patient remain on BB and at least \na low-dose ACEi if tolerated. Started lisinopril 2.5mg daily on \n___, patient tolerating well on discharge. Holding home \nentresto on discharge. \n\n#C difficile infection\nPt w frequent loose stools that developed during \nhospitalization, found to be cdiff+ on ___ and started on PO \nvanc ___. Switched to PO flagyl (___) as infection not \nconsidered to be complicated, for 10d course ending ___. \n\n___ \n#?CKD\nLikely multifactorial from CIN (given contrast on ___ at OSH), \nNSAID-use, valsartan in Entrosto +/- ATN. Cr 1.5 on admission \n___ and peaked to 3.4. Creatinine stable around 1.2-1.4 for \nthe week prior to discharge, baseline unknown but likely has \nsome underlying mild CKD. \n\n#Acute on chronic back pain  \n#Hip/leg pain\nPatient with hx of multiple prior spinal surgeries with hardware \nin place and spinal osteomyelitis/discitis/epidural abscess in \n___. He presented with 4 days of worsening back pain. CRP 50, \nconcerning for infectious process, however MRI showed no e/o \ninfection. Spine surgery consulted and no acute intervention \nneeded. XR b/l femur showed generalized degenerative changes \nthroughout b/l SI joints, hip joints, and pubic symphysis. No \nfracture.

She reports that \nabout one month ago she developed a burning and tingling \nsensation in her distal arms and hands. This sensation \nsubsequently spread to involve her lower extremities and saddle \nregion as well. About one week ago she developed an unusual \nsensation on the left side of her face and today she started \nfeeling tingling in her lips. Other complaints include an \nunusual sensation in her bladder when it becomes full (although \nshe denies any frank incontinence), involuntary contraction and \ncramping of the finger flexors of her hand, and involuntary \ntwitching and movement of the muscles in her limbs/back/and \nbuttocks.\n  \nThis study was requested to evaluate for a possible subacute \ninflammatory \npolyradiculoneuropathy (e.g. ___ syndrome or one of \nits variants).\n\nDirected neurological examination showed normal muscle bulk and \ntone. Strength was 4 to 4+/5 in the bilateral finger extensors, \nfinger abductors, arm flexors, arm extensors, and toe extensors; \nthe remainder of the muscles tested in the upper and lower \nextremities were ___. Sensation was reduced to temperature in \nthe distal lower extremities but was intact to vibration \nthroughout. Deep tendon reflexes were absent at the bilateral \npatellars and Achilles and reduced at the triceps bilaterally. A \nnormal biceps and brachioradialis reflex was obtained \nbilaterally. \n  \nFINDINGS: \n\nLeft tibial motor nerve conduction studies were normal, \nincluding minimum and maximum F wave latencies. \n  \nRight deep peroneal motor nerve conduction studies were normal. \nAlthough \nminimum F wave latencies were normal, the Fmax/Fmin difference \nwas markedly increased, with a single F wave of extremely long \nlatency.  \n  \nLeft median motor nerve conduction studies were normal; minimum \nF wave \nlatencies were mildly prolonged; Fmax/min difference was within \nnormal limits. \n  \nLeft ulnar motor nerve conduction studies showed a mildly \nprolonged distal \nlatency as well as moderate focal slowing of conduction velocity \nacross the elbow segment; motor response amplitudes were normal; \nminimum and maximum F wave latencies were normal. \n  \nThere was no evidence of temporal dispersion or increased \nduration or \nconduction blocking in any motor nerve studied. \n  \nLeft ulnar motor nerve conduction studies, recording FDI, were \nnormal. \n  \nLeft radial motor conduction studies were normal. \n  \nComparative motor recordings of the left median and ulnar \nnerves, recording ___ palmar interossous, revealed \nnormal median conduction across the wrist. \n  \nLeft and right facial motor nerve conduction studies recording \nat the nasalis were normal. \n  \nBilateral sural sensory nerve conduction studies were normal. \n  \nRight median sensory nerve conduction studies were normal. \n  \nLeft median sensory nerve conduction studies showed moderately \nreduced \namplitude and mildy reduced conduction velocity. \n  \nLeft ulnar sensory nerve conduction studies demonstrated a \nmildly reduced \namplitude, moderately prolonged distal latency, and markedly \nreduced \nconduction velocity. \n  \nLeft superficial radial sensory nerve conduction studies showed \na mildly \nreduced amplitude and normal conduction velocity. \n  \nLeft sural sensory nerve conduction studies were normal. \n  \nLeft median-radial digit 1 comparison study was within normal \nlimits. \n  \nBlink reflex testing stimulating the left supraorbital nerve \nshowed a \nprolonged R1 and ipsilateral R2 response, and a normal \ncontralateral R2 \nresponse. \n  \nBlink reflex testing stimulating the right supraorbital nerve \nshowed a normal R1 response with a prolonged ipsilateral and \ncontralateral R2 response. \n  \nConcentric needle electromyography (EMG) of selected muscles \nrepresenting the left C5-T1 myotomes demonstrated mildly reduced \nrecruitment in most muscles tested, with this pattern being most \nprominent in the triceps. With the exception of minimal \nfasciculations present in the left Abductor pollicis brevis, \nthere was otherwise no evidence of ongoing denervation or \nreinnervation (i.e. no spontaneous activity and normal motor \nunit morphology) in any of the muscles studied.\n \nConcentric needle electromyography (EMG) of selected muscles \nrepresenting the left L2-S1 myotomes demonstrated mildly reduced \nrecruitment in all muscles tested. There was otherwise no \nevidence of ongoing denervation or \nreinnervation (i.e. no spontaneous activity and normal motor \nunit morphology) in any of the muscles studied. \n  \nEMG of the paraspinal musculature at the L5 level showed no \nspontaneous \nactivity. The Left paraspinal muscle at the C7 level was also \ntested, however this study was limited due to the patient's \ninability to relax. \n))\n\nCXR ___:\nUNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITION: \n   ___ year old woman with polyneuropathy vs. polyradiculopathy  \nREASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION: \n   Eval for findings c/w sarcoidosis  \nFINDINGS: No previous images. The heart is normal in size and \nlungs are \nclear without vascular congestion or pleural effusion. \nSpecifically, no \nevidence of hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy or interstitial \nprominence to suggest sarcoidosis radiographically. \n\nC-spine MR ___:\nHISTORY: Bilateral arm tingling after heavy lifting. \nCOMPARISON: ___. \nFINDINGS:\nOn the sagittal images, there is no malalignment or loss of \nvertebral body \nheight. No suspect marrow lesions are seen. No pathologic \nenhancement is \nseen. The craniovertebral junction is unremarkable. The cord is \nnormal in \nsignal intensity and morphology. Cervical spondylotic changes \nare stable \nincluding a broad-based disc osteophyte complex at C5-C6 with \nsevere narrowing of the right foramen. The previously suspected \ncord signal abnormality from C4 through C7 is not reproduced and \nwas likely artifact on the prior examination. \nIMPRESSION: No acute abnormality. Stable degenerative changes.\n\n**See hospital course for laboratory studies and results.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ is a ___ right-handed woman with past \nmedical history significant only for asthma and migraines who \nwas admitted to our general neurology service after three weeks \nof painful dysesthesia that initially began in her left upper \nextremity along with an area of pruritis over her left face. The \ndysesthetic sensation then spread to her right upper extremity \nand then to her lower extremities bilaterally (distal--\u003eproximal \nin LEs). Overt neurological deficits were minor, but some \nweakness was detected in her left finger extensors and her \nsensory exam was notable for decreased temperature as well as \nvibratory signs in the left lower extremity and decreased \ntemperature signs in the left upper extremity. Pinprick \nsensation was normal throughout her extremities, abdomen, and \nback. Reflexes were normal except for absence at the patellae \nbilaterally (a stable finding throughout this admission). Gait \nand coordination were normal throughout this admission, and the \npatient was pleasant, conversational, and interactive / walking \naround the floor frequently with the exception of a few days \nafter LP when she was suffering from a positional post-LP HA. \nShe occasionally complained of lacking of a normal sensation of \nbladder fullness despite subseqent large-volume urination. No \nurinary frequency or incontinence at any time.\n\nMRI of C-spine was repeated and previously-identified T2 signal \nin C-spine (parenchymal) was no longer seen, thought to be a \nmotion artifact on ___ image. C5-6 right-sided foraminal \ndisc-encroachment / narrowing was again seen.\n\nLP was performed on the floor ___ with the following results: \nno polys or organisms seen on gram stain. Protein elevated at 79 \nand oligoclonal bands were identified (9; uln is 5). 6 WBC-98% \nlymphs / 2 RBC (tube #4).\n\nESR was normal (5), but CRP was elevated at 18.9 (___). ___ \nwas negative, as was sm antibody testing, RF, ANCA, and dsDNA -- \nall normal / negative. C3/C4 complement levels were within \nnormal limits (138/26). Serum ACE negative, CXR (w.r.t. possible \nsarcoidosis) was normal. RPR was NR. Lyme serum and CSF antibody \ntesting was negative. HIV serum Ab screen was negative. No \nabnormality was identified on SPEP. IgA level was normal (189, \nw.r.t. IVIG pre-planning). TSH 0.73 / fT4 1.2 (wnl both). B12 \nwas wnl at 444.\n\nGabapentin was started at 300mg tid and up-titrated to 400mg qid \nwith some relief. Her pain control was augmented with Vicodin \nPRN, which was used frequently. Given the peripheral/radicular \nlocalization of the patient's dysesthetic polyneuropathy and \nmild weakness on exam, and after an EMG found mild abnormalities \nc/w GBS variant, and after no lesions could be identified \nconsistent with a demyelinating intra-axial lesion such as MS \ncould be identified on MRI, a presumptive diagnosis was made of \na sensory-predominant GBS variant. Mrs. ___ was then treated \nwith IVIG 0.4g/d over five days, with no side effects, but also \nminimal to no improvement of her dysesthesia. Neurologic exam \nwas normal (no weakness could be detected) by the time of \ndischarge. She was discharged to home with gabapentin and \nVicodin for pain relief, and instructed to follow up with Dr. \n___ in Neurology clinic in ___.\n \nMedications on Admission:\n-birth control pill, extended cycle to minimize pre-menstrual \nmigraine HAs\n-vicodin one and a half tab q6h\n-previously Tramadol for migraine HA\n-previously Ambien 10mg PRN for insomnia\n-previously amitryptaline 25 for pain\n-finished prednisone 1d PTA (started by PCP in attempt to \ncontrol dysesthesia)\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

She was initially given \nintravenous fluids.\n. \nHer daughter, ___, who is her healthcare proxy came in on the \nday after admission for a family meeting with the team and \nsocial workers.  At that meeting it was decided the best course \nof action was to continue with comfort care, as previously \ndecided.  \n. \n#Agitation:  The agitation was most likely related to terminal \ndisease and azotemia from ARF found on lab studies drawn in the \nemergency department.  The patient was continued on Ativan and \nZyprexa to decrease agitation.  As pain control may have been \ncontributing to her agitation, the patient was placed on Tylenol \nand morphine PRN for grimacing, increased HR/RR or any other \nevidence of pain.  The palliative care team was also consulted \nto help with symptom management.  \n.  \n#ARF:  The patient was found to have an elevated creatinine from \nher baseline on labs checked in the ___.  There is a likely \ncomponent of prerenal from poor PO intake vs. renal, possibly \nobstructive from intraabdominal process. Per family request,  \nthe patient received IVF briefly. She did not have a Foley \nplaced as this was against the family's wishes. \n.  \n#Metastatic Colon Cancer: The patient was on home hospice. She \nwas brought in partly because of difficulty in watching patient \nbecome agitated.  She was treated for pain with Tylenol RTC and \nMorphine PRN for grimacing, increased HR/RR or any other \nevidence of pain.  She was also started on a scopolamine patch \nto decrease secretions.  Her secretions were treated with \nscopolamine patch and Levsin as well as oxygen by nasal cannula \nfor comfort. \n\nThe patient was made comfort measures only and medications as \nabove were started.\nShe died with her daughter at her bedside.\n\n  \n\n \nMedications on Admission:\nFentanyl 25 mcg/hr Patch 72 hr  \nFentanyl 12 mcg/hr Patch 72 hr  \nPsyllium 1.7 g Wafer PO tid  \nIpratropium Bromide 17 mcg 2 puffs qid  \nOxycodone 5 mg q 4hr PRN  \nOndansetron 4 mg q8 PRN  \nLorazepam 0.5 mg q 4hr PRN  \nAcetaminophen 325 mg q 6hr PRN  \nMiconazole 2% Powder PRN  \nOlanzapine 5 mg Tablet, Rapid Dissolve PO bid PRN Nausea \n \nDischarge Medications:\nN/A\n \nDischarge Disposition:\nExpired\n \nFacility:\n___\n \nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary diagnosis:\n#Metastatic colon cancer\nSecondary diagnosis:\n#HTN\n#OA\n\n \nDischarge Condition:\nPatient expired\n\n \nDischarge Instructions:\nN/A\n\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"}

There is mild regional left ventricular \nsystolic dysfunction with severe inferior and inferolateral \nhypokinesis. A dense endocardial stripe is seen in the basal \ninferolateral wall, consistent with acute myocardial edema \nsecondary to acute ischemia. The remaining segments contract \nnormally (LVEF = 40-45%). The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear \nstructurally normal with good leaflet excursion. The mitral \nvalve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no pericardial \neffusion. IMPRESSION Mild regional left ventricular systolic \ndysfunction, most consistent with an evolving \ninferior/inferolateral myocardial infarction. \n \n___ Cardiac Cath (PRELIM):\n___ COMMENTS:  Initial angiography revealed 80% mid LAD \ndisease, 80% ostial diagonal disease, 90% proximal LCx disease, \nand a tight thrombotic proximal RCA which was thought to be the \nculprit lesion for the STEMI.  We planned to treat the lesion \nwith PTCA and stenting.  Bivalirudin was started \nprophylactically.  A 6 ___ JR4 guiding catheter provided good \nsupport for the procedure.  A 0.014\" Prowater wire crossed the \nlesion with minimal difficulty.  The lesion was dilated with a \n2.0 x 8mm APEX OTW balloon at ___ ATM.  A 2.0 x ___ MINI VISION \nRX stent was deployed at 18 ATM.  Final angiography revealed no \nin-stent residual stenosis, no angiographically apparent \ndissection, and TIMI 3 flow.  The patient left the lab free of \nangina in stable condition. \n \nCOMMENTS:      \n1.  Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system \nrevealed angiographically apparent disease in three vessels. The \nLMCA had no obstructive disease. The LAD had a 80% proximal with \n80% ostial diagonal lesions. The LCx had a 90% proximal lesion. \nThe RCA had a tight thrombotic proximal lesion which was thought \nto be the culprit lesion causing STEMI and hypotension. \n2.  Limited resting hemodynamic showed relatively low central \naortic pressures of 98/56 mmHg. \n3.  Successful PCI of the RCA with a 2.0 x 12mm MINI VISION bare \nmetal stent.  Final angiograpy revealed no in-stent residual \nstenosis, no angiographically apparent dissection, and TIMI 3 \nflow. \n   \nFINAL DIAGNOSIS:     \n1. Inferior- inferolateral STEMI in this patient with MVA with \nmultiple fractures and low Hct 23% treated with BMS to the \nacutely thrombotic RCA. \n2. Continue ASA 81 mg and Plavix 75mg daily for at least 1 month \nif not longer. \n3. There is residual unrevascularized disease which may need \nCABG in future if continues to have anginal symptoms. \n4. Admit to CCU for post STEMI care. \n \n___ CXR: IMPRESSION:   1.  Retrocardiac opacity in the setting \nof low lung volumes is likely atelectasis, although in the \nproper clinical setting, pneumonia cannot be excluded. 2.  \nPartially imaged right scapula fracture. \n\n___ ECHO: The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is moderate \nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. There is mild to \nmoderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with \nthinned and echodense inferior / inferolateral segments with \nakinesis/hypokinesis and inferoseptal akinesis / hypokinesis. \nRight ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. \nThe aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The \nascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic arch is mildly \ndilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. \nThere is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets are \nmildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The \ntricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is at least \nmild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a \ntrivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

A XR of his right shoulder was done on HD 2 \nthat confirmed the known right scapular fx and showed chronic \nosteoarthritis. Imaging on admission had shown questionable \npulmonary contusios but the patient was weaned of oxygen and \nasymptomatic.  His respiratory status was closely monitored. On \nHD 2, the patient had episodes of anxiety and questionable \nsuicidal ideation. Psychiatry was consulted. His tertiary survey \nrevealed no additional injuries, and he was transferred to the \northopedic surgery team.\n \nCCU SERVICE:\n \nActive issues: \n# STEMI: While on the medicine floor patient became hypotensive \nSBP in the ___ and EKG showed 0.5-1mm STE in III,aVF,aVR with \nprofound ___ mmSTD V2-V6, I and aVL. ECHO showed apical \nhypokenisa/akenisa. Angioraphy showed multivessel disease with \n80% proximal LAD lesions, 80% ostial diagonal lesions, 90% \nproximal LCx lesions and a tight RCA thrombotic proximal lesion \nwhich was thought to be the culprit lesion causing STEMI and \nhypotension. 2 bare metal stents were placed into the RCA \nlesion. Given multivessel disease, if patient continues to have \nangina, may need CABG in the future. Patient was given \nbivalirudin before cath. ___ was initially held in setting \nof ___, and was later started. He did not have chest pain in his \nrecovery period, and his cardiac enzymes downtrended. He was \ndischarged with plavix 75mg daily, ASA 81mg daily, Atorvastatin \n80 mg daily, metoprolol XL 100mg, and Valsartan 80mg daily. He \nwas arranged for follow up in cardiology clinic at the ___.\n \n# PUMP: ECHO showed EF of 40%, with moderate symmetric left \nventricular hypertrophy, mild to moderate regional left \nventricular systolic dysfunction, with thinned and echodense \ninferior/inferolateral segments with akinesis/hypokinesis and \ninferoseptal akinesis/hypokinesis. He was started on metoprolol \nand valsartan. He will follow up in cardiology clinic, and will \nlikely need a repeat echo as outpatient to evaluate his cardiac \nfunction. \n \n# Encephalopathy: His serum alcohol level was elevated on \nadmission, and he exhibited symptoms of withdrawal during this \nadmission. He has a history of withdrawal seizures and was \ndrinking heavily prior to admission and still within the 72-96 \nhour window for DT. When CIWA was discontinued patient became \nmore diaphoretic and agitated. While this is likely alcohol \nwithdrawal, other etiologies of delirium including medications \n(benzos and opidates), metabolic (hyponatremia), infection, \nanemia, and decreased forward flow due to MI may also be \ncontributing. He was given Lorazepam ___ Q1H PRN for CIWA \u003e 10 \nas we as folate, thiamine, multivitamin. He was weaned off \nbenzodiazepines, and received a short course of haldol (0.5mg \nBID prn) prior to discharge. At the time of discharge, he was \nfully alert and oriented, and did not have symptoms of alcohol \nwithdrawal.\n \n# Anemia: Hct was 24 down from 42 at admission at POD #3. There \nis likely a combination of intraoperative loss, myelosuppression \nfrom alcohol vs active bleeding. No signs of active bleeding. No \nknown h/o GIB or anemia.  \nHe was transfused a total of three units while in the hospital \nand his Hct went up appropriately. At the time of discharge his \nhematocrit was stable at 33.\n \n# Acute Kidney Injury: Cr 1.4 up from baseline 0.8 at admission, \nBUN also up to 32 from ___ yesterday, implying prerenal \ncomponent. DDx also includes ATN, AIN. Patient was hypotensive \nSBP to the ___, he received gentamicin post-op, and had 220cc of \nconstrast during cath. UOP has been adequate so obstruction \nseems unlikely. We monitoed his Cr and renally dosed his \nmedications. His valsartan and chlorthalidone were initially \nheld, and his valsartan was restarted once his renal function \nimproved. At the time of discharge, his Cr was stable at 1.2 \n(baseline 0.9-1.1).\n \n# R open grade iiiB Tib/Fib fracture and R scapular body \nfracture. s/p I\u0026D and ORIF of open R tib/fib fracture on ___. \nGiven Ancef pre and post-op and Gentamicin for 3 days post-op. \nHe developed cellulitis around his surgical site in the days \npost-op, and was treated with vancomycin. At the time of \ndischarge, his RLE erythema and edema were much improved. He was \ntransitioned to oral clindamycin on discharge, and will have \nfollow up in ___ clinic.\n  \n# Leukocytosis: Differential: infection vs. acute stress from \nthe STEMI. WBC initially 8, trended up to 12.7 on HD#1, then \ntrended down until ___ when it rose again to 12.6 then back \ndown to 9.0 on ___. UA and CXR underwhelming for infection \nfrom admission. New hardware placed during surgery ___. \nReceived cefazolin pre and post-op, and gentamicin for 3 days \npost-op. Has had low grade fevers to 100.8 while on standing \nacetaminophen and IV gentamycin. No localizing signs/symptoms on \nexam or history, CT chest from admission with ? aspiration in R \nlung.

We took you to a procedure called a cardiac \ncatheterization to look at the arteries that supply the heart \nmuscle with oxygenated blood which revealed that you had fresh \nclot in your right coronary artery blocking that artery. You \nalso have two other blockages in the LAD or left anterior \ndescending artery as well as the left circumflex artery. We \nfixed the right coronary artery by placing two stents to open \nthe blockage as we thought that was the blockage causing the \nproblem. You still have two blockages that we will treat for now \nwith medications but becuase of this it is very important that \nyou report any symptoms of chest pain to Dr. ___ if \nunrelieved call ___.\n \nBecause of your heart attack you are now on the following \nmedications:\n1. Aspirin 81mg daily.\n2. Atorvastatin 80mg daily (an anticholesterol medication)\n3. Plavix 75 mg daily : This keeps the stent open and should not \nbe stopped for any reason unless Dr. ___ says to \nstop it. Stopping this medication early COULD cause you to have \nanother lifethreatening heart attack)\n4. Metoprolol Xl 100mg daily: This decreases the workload of the \nheart.\n5. Valsartan 80mg daily: This medication decreases the pressure \nthe heart has to pump against. \n6. Nitroglycerine as needed with chest pain: these are tabs you \nplace under your tongue and use only when you have chest pain. \nIt is important that if you require this medication because you \nare having chest pain more with increased frequency you should \ncontact your cardiologist Dr. ___. \n \nAt the time of the heart attack your heart pumping function was \nalso depressed or decreased. This is called heart failure. The \ndrugs, Valsartan and Metorprolol decrease the workload of the \nheart and should help prevent worseing of your heart failure.\n \nBecause of your open fracture of your right leg you will need to \nchange the dressing every day. If you notice drainage from the \nsite that is purulent or with pus you need to call the surgeons \nand be seen. OTher signs of infection are listed below as danger \nsigns.\n \nBecause of your history fo alcoholism it is really important \nthat you continue your plans to attend AA and avoid alcohol \nconsumption. Becasue of chronic alcohol intake you were in need \nof electrolytes to supplement your poor state of nutrition. You \nshould continue taking a multivitamin and thiamine daily.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"}

Due to his inability to \nambulate on\nthe treadmill due to dizziness and unsteady gait, the study was\nconverted to Pharmacological/mibi. He received 0.142mg/kg/min of \nIV\nPersantine infused over 4 minutes. He denied any chest, arm, \nneck or\nback discomfort throughout the infusion or in recovery. There \nwere no\nchanges in ST segments or T waves noted throughout the study. \nThe rhythm\nwas sinus with intermittent bouts of frequent single PVC's seen\nthroughout. There was marked hypertension at rest with an \nappropriate\ndrop in blood pressure with the Persantine infusion. At 2 \nminutes post\ninfusion, 125mg IV Aminophylline was given to reverse any \npotential\nPersantine side effects.\n \nIMPRESSION: No ischemic ECG changes. No anginal type symptoms.\nAppropriate hemodynamic response to Persantine. Post test \nprobability\nfor ischemia is low. Nuclear report sent separately\n\nCARDIAC PERFUSION REPORT\nIMPRESSION:  Unchanged normal myocardial perfusion.  New mildly \nreduced function\nwith LVEF of 40%.\nECHO ___:\nThe left atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. \nThere is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal \ncavity size and global systolic function (LVEF\u003e55%). Due to \nsuboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality \ncannot be fully excluded. The aortic root is mildly dilated at \nthe sinus level. The aortic arch is mildly dilated. The aortic \nvalve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is \nnot present. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral \nvalve leaflets are mildly thickened. The tricuspid valve \nleaflets are mildly thickened. The estimated pulmonary artery \nsystolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality due to body habitus. Mild \nsymmetric LVH. Left ventricular systolic function is probably \nnormal, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be excluded. The \nright ventricle is not well seen. Mild aortic regurgitation. \nNormal pulmonary artery systolic pressure. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe findings are similar. \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ with a history of HTN and T2DM who \npresented with chest pain, initally thought to have acute \nsystolic CHF based on prior MIBI EF of 40%, however after echo \nappears to have no acute change in cardiac function.\n\n# Chest Pain: Pt vague chest pain that is worse with palpation \nand not specifically related to exertion, patient has been \nreporting similar chest pain for the last several weeks and has \nbeen evaluated by cardiology several times in the past without \nfinding of macrovascular coronary artery disease or ischemia. \nUpon this presentaiton to the ED patient had negative troponins \nand no EKG changes.  Patient was initially admitted by the ED to \nobservation for a stress test, but due to dizziness and fatigue \nwas not able to complete his exam which was converted to a \nstress MIBI.  The radionucleotide exam suggested an EF of 40% \nwhich was reduced from an ECHO study several years prior and \npatient was admitted for evaluation of newly depressed EF.  \nDiuresis was initiated in the emergency department though no \nfindings of volume overload on exam, lab studies, history or \nimaging could be ascertained.  Diuresis was held after patient \nwas admitted to cardiology and an ECHO cardiogram was performed \nwhich did not show a significant change from prior.  The \npatient's chest pain was not felt to be related to ischemia or \nmacrovascular disease nor was it felt to be caused by a primary \npulmonary process.  It was very easily reproducible to palpation \nof the left pectoralis muscle and by maneuvers manipulating the \nshoulder gertale.   There was no indication for cardiac cath \nbased on the perfusion study performed in the emergency \ndepartment, patient was continued on home aspirin and ___, \nrecent lipid profile did not suggest statin therapy was \nindicated at this time.  As patient was established on a \nnarcotics contract and pain requirements did not exceed his \noutpatient percocet dosing no increases in his narcotics were \nmade patient was prescribed Naproxen for pain control.  \n.\n-# HTN: mildly elevated to 140s, patient was continued on home \ndiltizem and ___.\n.\n# T2DM: On metformin at home. Last A1C 6.8% in ___. patient \nwas continued on metformin at the time of discharge.\n-\n.\n# LIPIDS: LDL of 98 with normal HDL in ___ of this year, \nstatin therapy not currently indicated.\n.\n# BPH: cont tamsulosin and oxybutynin\n.\nTransitional Issues: \n-PFTS as out pt if respiratory symptoms continue to limit \nexercise capacity.\n-recommend weight loss and exercise as an out patient\n \nMedications on Admission:\nPreadmissions medications listed are incomplete and require \nfuther investigation.

Of note patient was constantly seeking \nIV pain meds every hour though on exam did not appear to be in \novert distress. We finally agreed to control pain\nwith home meds (did not appear in acute distress and easily \ndistracted from pain during conversation/physical exam). Of note \npart of the reason we tried to avoid IV meds is the significant \namount she received on admission which led patient being sleepy \nand sedated on ___ morning.

The day of presentation the patient went to see her \nPCP and was found to have a full body convalescent erythematous \nrash as well as ___ to 2.3 from a baseline of 1.2 or 1.5. She \nwas referred to ___. Suspicion was highest for AIN due to \nceftazidime causing her ___ and ___. Two days into the \nadmission the patient spiked a fever to 100.5, asymptomatic. She \nwas started on zosyn given her neutropenia initially then \nmeropenem given concern for cross-reactivity with penicillins \nand cephalosporins. She continued to have intermittent low grade \nfevers despite no symptoms and underwent chest CT which found \ncavitary RUL lesion. She was taken for bronchoscopy on ___ \nwith BAL with studies sent for bacterial, fungal, and AFB \nculture. Studies all negative for new infectious source. Rash \nand ___ resolved but new confluent erythematous rash appeared, \nthought to be likely to meropenem. Meropenem was held in favor \nof ciprofloxacin but on ___ patient began to spike fevers and \nbecame hypotensive to SBP ___. She was given fluids and \ntransferred to the ICU where she was put on vanc, gentamicin, \nciprofloxacin, and micafungin. Further infectious workup yielded \nno infectious source. She briefly required pressors and \ncontinued to receive fluids. After 2 days she was weaned off \npressors and discontinued vanc, gent, mica and continued on IV \ncipro and transferred back to the floor where she was monitored \non IV cipro for 2 days and then transitioned to po cipro with an \nadditional day of monitoring prior to discharge with close \nfollow-up.\n\n# Febrile neutropenia\n# RUL Abscess\nPatient presented Neutropenia likely due to underlying MDS. ___ \nfevers starting day 2 of hospitalization, was started on zosyn \nthen meropenem for febrile neutropenia.
