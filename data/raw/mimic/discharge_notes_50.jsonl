There does not appear to be cortical erosion of bone \nor hyperostosis. There is no pronounced perilesional edema. No \nother mass is seen. There is small calcification in the left \ntemporal lobe. There is no shift of normally midline structures. \nMastoid air cells are clear. Visualized paranasal sinuses are \nclear. The orbits appear unremarkable. \nIMPRESSION: Right frontal enhancing mass with necrotic interior \nmost likely a brain neoplasm. Consider MR for further \ncharacterization. \n\nCT Torso ___:\nCT CHEST: The airways are patent up to subsegmental level. There \nare no \nconcerning airspace opacities, or pulmonary nodules. There is no \npleural \neffusion. There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in \nthe mediastinum, hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria. \nThere are subcentimeter lymph nodes in the axilla; however do \nnot meet the CT criteria for pathological enlargement. Calcified \nnodes are also seen in the mediastinum. The heart size is \nnormal. There is no pericardial effusion.   \nCT ABDOMEN: The liver, pancreas, spleen appear normal. The \nadrenal glands \nare normal. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete \ncontrast \nsymmetrically with bilateral hypodensities too small to \ncharacterize, likely small renal cysts. The gallbladder appears \nnormal with gallstones within. There are no pathologically \nenlarged lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum or mesentery. The \nloops of small and large bowel appear normal. The stomach \nappears normal. There is no free fluid. There is no free air.   \nCT PELVIS: The urinary bladder and ureters appear normal. The \nsigmoid and \nloops of small bowel within the pelvis appear normal. There is \nno free fluid in the pelvis. There are no enlarged lymph nodes \nin the pelvic or inguinal area according to CT size criteria. \nOSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are \nseen in the bones. \nIMPRESSION: \n1. No evidence of primary tumor in the CT torso. \n2. Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis. \n\nMRI Head ___:\nFINDINGS: There is a 2.7 cm round circumscribed extra-axial mass \nat the right vertex, depressing the paracentral lobule \ninferiorly. There is mild \nassociated vasogenic edema in the adjacent frontal and parietal \nlobes. The \nmass demonstrates isointensity on the pre-contrast T1-weighted \nimages, mild hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, neither fast \nnor slow diffusion, and predominantly solid enhancement with a \nsmall non-enhancing center on the postcontrast T1-weighted \nimages. A small portion of the non-enhancing center demonstrates \nlow signal on the gradient-echo images without evidence of \nblooming, which is somewhat more likely to represent \ncalcification rather than blood products. Faint hyperdensity \nwithin the mass on the preceding CT scan is compatible with \neither calcification or blood products. Overall, the mass is \nmost consistent with a meningioma.  \nNo other intra-axial or extra-axial masses are seen. The \nventricles are \nnormal in size and configuration. There is no acute infarction. \nThe major \narterial flow voids are unremarkable. \nIMPRESSION: 2.7 cm extra-axial mass at the right vertex, most \nlikely a \nmeningioma, with mild vasogenic edema in the paracentral lobule. \n\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nPatient is a ___ who is transferred from OSH after \nidentification of new right parietal mass in the setting of \nseizure.

His \nPCP was contacted and noted patient did not have any history of \nVTE or PE in the time that he has known him ___ years). He had \nhypercoagulability workup at OSH with negative ___, at-3, \nprotein c,s, d-dimer, pt/ptt all of which were WNL. His PCP also \nnoted that he does not prescribe the patient narcotics, and the \npatient himself notes that he doesn't see PCPs. He underwent \nbronchoscopy done in OR ___ without any lesions or signs of \nbleeding, EGD which showed hematin in the stomach without any \nsigns of bleeding, ENT exam ___ which showed no evidence of \nbleeding. H/H were monitored throughout that admission and were \nstable, and per the discharge summary, though he produced blood \nin specimen cups, no healthcare providers were ever able to \nwitness true hemoptysis or hematemesis.\n\nFor full ___ records, please see scanned records.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nBRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE\n================\nMr. ___ is a ___ year old gentleman with reported history of \nVTE/PEs without confirmatory imaging not on warfarin, recently \nadmitted to ___ with hemoptysis but extensive workup was \nnegative, re-presenting with unwitnessed hematemesis. \nHemodynamically stable, stable hematocrit, no emesis during \nadmission. Coorborated negative history of DVT/ PE from outside \nrecords. Patient has been to numerous hospitals over past few \nyears without clear precipitants. He was discharged to follow up \nwith a new PCP.\n\nACTIVE ISSUES\n==========\n# Hematemesis - During this admission the patient did not have \nany episodes of emesis in the ED or while on the floor. In \nhouse, his hematocrit was stable. Work-up of hematemesis at \n___ within the last week has included (1) EGD \n(2) ENT exam (3) bronchoscopy, all of which were unrevealing. \nHis EGD was noted to have hematin in the stomach, but the \nunderlying mucosa was normal and without any source of bleeding. \nIn the ED, NG lavage was negative, he had guaiac positive stool, \nwhich in the setting of recent NG tube placement, multiple \nrecent hospitalizations (most recently that we know of was one \nweek ago) with multiple instances of GI instrumentation - guaiac \npositive stool is expected. Throughout this admission, he was \nhemodynamically stable and with stable HCT, as such, we treated \nconservatively and decreased his PO pantoprazole because of low \nsuspicion of peptic ulcer disease. Per nursing, he may have \nhistory of sucking blood from ___ and ingesting it or vomiting \nit up, though this is unconfirmed (though at ___, he did have \nold blood in his stomach without evidence of ulcer disease).\n*** Please see \"Results\" section for brief synopsis of ___ \nrecords. ***\n\n# Chest pain: He reported chest pain that was stable and \nconstant. He had an EKG on admission without evidence of R heart \nstrain and no evidence of ischemia. He is low risk for ACS and \ndoes not report a history of CAD, and as his pain is stable and \nongoing in the setting of non-ischemic EKG, as such we deferred \nformal ischemia work-up and monitored on telemetry without any \nconcerning changes. In addition, per OSH records does not have \nany documented pulmonary emboli; he reports 5 PEs in the past \nbut has not been on anticoagulation. He was hemodynamically \nstable, without hypoxia, tachycardia, or concerning EKG signs, \nas such there was minimal indication for CT-A.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES\n===========\n# Reported history of DVT, PE, hypercoagulability: As above, his \nwork-up was negative. Per OSH records he does not have any \ndocumented history of VTEs. He reported he has no-showed \"about \nfive\" appointments for ___ placement. He does not \nhave any H\u0026P findings concerning for DVT, and we held off on \ntreatment.\n\n# Chronic back pain: We continued his home medications in house, \nwhich he reports were prescribed by a doctor in ___. He \nreports he hasn't seen a primary care provider in years, and \ndoes not go to primary care providers, only hospital. We \ndischarged with 2 days of pain medications and referred him to a \nnew PCP in the ___.\n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\n==============\n- Code status: Full code, confirmed.\n- Emergency contact: Mother, ___ ___\n- Studies pending at discharge: None.\n- Low suspicion for GI bleed and hypercoagulability, but \nconsider GI referral as outpatient. Please also consider \npsychiatry evaluation as there is some element of \nprimary/secondary gain in his frequent presentations.\n*** Please see \"Results\" section for brief synopsis of ___ \nrecords. ***\n- Would benefit from close follow-up to avoid multiple \nre-admissions.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

The P2 to P4 segments \nof the bilateral PCAs not well demonstrated and may be due to \nsuboptimal bolus timing. However narrowing of the distal PCAs \ncannot be excluded. However the rest of the ___ \nimage major branches demonstrate no high-grade stenosis, \nocclusion or aneurysm greater than 3 mm. The dural venous \nsinuses are patent.\n \nCT neck\nThere is mild-to-moderate calcified atherosclerosis of the \ncommon carotid\nwithout mild stenosis without occlusion or dissection. The left \ninternal\ncarotid artery demonstrates mild to moderate narrowing by NASCET \ncriteria\nsecondary to calcified atherosclerosis. The right internal \ncarotid artery\ndemonstrates no stenosis by NASCET criteria. The vertebral \narteries\ndemonstrate minimal atherosclerosis without high-grade stenosis, \nocclusion or dissection.\n \nOther\nMultiple borderline mediastinal lymph nodes do not meet CT \ncriteria for\nlymphadenopathy. The ascending aorta is aneurysmal and measures \nup to 4.2 cm. The main pulmonary artery measures up to 3.0 cm \nand is borderline enlarged which may suggest some component of \npulmonary artery hypertension.\n \nMild biapical pleuroparenchymal scarring. The visualized lungs \ndemonstrate no nodularity or consolidation. The visualized \nthyroid is unremarkable.\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nMr. ___ is a ___ right-handed man with history \nnotable for atrial fibrillation (on apixaban), HTN, HLD, CAD, \nOSA (on CPAP), C7-T1 radiculopathy s/p ESI, bipolar II disorder, \nand subclinical hypothyroidism who presented to the ___ \nemergency department after an episode of dizziness, syncope, and \nsubsequent left-sided weakness. Due to the left-sided weakness, \nneurology was consulted with concern for stroke. He was admitted \nto the neurology service. Notably, he has had several prior \nepisodes of presyncope and vertigo provoked by climbing stairs \nat his work, but not in other settings and not. Without \nprovocation\n\nNeurologic exam was generally unremarkable, with full strength \nthroughout. There was some give way on the left side. \n___ maneuver was negative. CT scan of the head, and CTA \nof the head neck were unrevealing for any acute pathology. Lab \nwork did not suggest any evidence of hypovolemia or other \nsignificant derangement. Orthostatic vital signs were negative. \nTelemetry monitoring did not capture any arrhythmia. He was able \nto ambulate around the floor, as well as up and down stairs, \nwithout any reproduction of his symptoms.\n\nOverall, his symptoms of presyncope and vertigo were not \nsuggestive of stroke. MRI brain was therefore not obtained. \nBased on his reassuring exam, there is no immediately apparent \nneurologic diagnosis to explain his symptoms. As he has had \nextensive cardiac evaluation in the past, this was not repeated \nhere. We recommend he continue to follow with his primary care \ndoctor as well as cardiologist given the exertional nature of \nhis symptoms. Referral to ENT could also be considered.\n\nThis patient was prescribed, or continued on, an opioid pain \nmedication at the time of discharge (please see the attached \nmedication list for details). As part of our safe opioid \nprescribing process, all patients are provided with an opioid \nrisks and treatment resource education sheet and encouraged to \ndiscuss this therapy with their outpatient providers to \ndetermine if opioid pain medication is still indicated.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

However, mild pulmonary edema is still present. The \nheart is \nenlarged in unchanged manner and a right pleural effusion with \nsubsequent \natelectasis is still present.  Unchanged position of the \npacemaker leads. \n\nTEE ___:\nNo spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of \nthe left atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right \natrium/right atrial appendage. A patch is visualized at inferior \nportion of the interatrial septum and extending below the level \nof the tricuspid valve, consistent with known previous \nendocardial cushion defect repair. Flow is seen by color Doppler \nacross the atrial portion of the patch c/w with a small residual \nshunt. The superior portion of the interatrial septum is not \nwell visualized. Overall left ventricular systolic function is \nlow normal (LVEF 50-55%). Right ventricular chamber size is \nnormal. with depressed free wall contractility. The aortic valve \nleaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet \nexcursion. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve \nleaflets are mildly/moderately thickened. There is no mitral \nvalve prolapse. The posterior mitral leaflet appears short and \nrestricted with lack of coaptation with the anterior leaflet. An \neccentric, posteriorly directed jet of Moderate to severe (3+) \nmitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic \npressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial \neffusion. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed) of ___, \nthe degree of mitral regurgitation is probably similar (likely \nunderestimated due to the very eccentric jet previously). A \nsmall residual shunt across the interatrial patch is better seen \non the current study. Other findings are similar.  \n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ w/ h/o endocardial cushion and ASD defect s/p repair as \nchild, CHF (LVEF ___ =60%), moderate-severe MR, afib s/p PPM \np/w acute dyspnea in context of missing lasix dose and with \nrecurrent R pleural effusion.  \n\nACTIVE ISSUES:\n\n#dCHF: pt presented with symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea, and PND \nand on exam was mildly volume overloaded. pro-BNP was elevated \nto \u003e1700. An echo 3 weeks prior to admission revealed no \ninterval changes but moderate-severe mitral regurgitation. The \npt was diuresed with lasix 20 mg IV x2 with symptomatic \nimprovement. Her oxygen requirement of 2L NC was gradually \nweaned off. A TEE to further evaluate her mitral regurgitation \ndid not reveal a worsening MR or systolic/diastolic function. \nShe was deemed to not be a surgical candidate at this time. She \nwas discharged on lasix 20mg PO qday.\n\n#Pleural Effusion: pt presented with acute dyspnea and a CXR \nrevealed a large pleural effusion on the right side. The left \nside was normal. This is a recurrent effusion and previous \nthoracenteses have revealed that it is transudative in nature. \nIt is thought to be related to heart failure. Given the ___ \nprevious instances of this effusion, it was decided that instead \nof attempting another thoracentesis, the pt would be diuresed. \nShe was given lasix 20mg IV x2 with negative output of -1.6L x2 \ndays. This resulted in signifcant improvement of her dyspnea and \nher pleural effusion. Her lasix was increased from her home dose \nof 20mg PO QOD to 20mg PO qday. \n\n#AFIB s/p PPM: pt had her pacemaker interrogated to assess if it \nwere malfunctioning and if this could have contributed to her \nrecurrent effusions and dCHF exacerbation. It was found to be \nworking appropriately after interrogation. She was continued on \nher home metoprolol but her rivaroxaban was held for a TEE and \nrestarted on discharge.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n\n#DMII: her home anti-glycemics were held and she was placed on \nan insulin sliding scale\n\n#HLD: she was continued on her home statin\n\n#seizure: she was continued on her home phenobarbital \n\n#thombocytopenia: likely related to phenobarbital. she was \nrunning at her baseline. \n\nTransitional issues:\n- monitor response to increased dose of furosemide (20mg daily)\n- repeat CXR to confirm resolution of effusion\n- Lung nodule seen anterior to the spine on the lateral view of \ninitial chest X-ray. consider CT to further evaluate when \neffusion and pulmonary edema resolve\n- medication reconciliation and teaching\n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

You were found to have a recurrent, \nlarge pleural effusion in the your lung. A pleural effusion is a \ncollection of fluid in the tissue surrounding your lungs. It was \nsimilar to the ones you have had drained before. We did not use \na needle the drain the fluid this time, but rather increased \nyour lasix dose to help take some of the fluid off. You also had \na transesophageal echo to evaluate your heart valves more \nclosely to see if they could be causing your pleural effusion. \n\nWeigh yourself every morning and call your PCP if your weight \nincreases by more than 2 pounds.

Most likely source of infection was skin/soft tissue \nsince this was his predominant complaint. CT and MRI of the \nlower extremities were not consistent with necrotizing fascitis. \nSkin continued to worsen over the first 3 days of hospital \ncourse, and developed dramatic bullae in dependent regions of \nthe LEs. Paracentesis with 250 polys implied either a primary or \nsecondary intra-abdominal process. Patient received albumin on \ndiagnosis and 2 days later for renal prophylaxis in the setting \nof SBP. Blood cultures from admission eventually grew \npansensitive Strep penumonia and he was initially managed on \nvancomycin, ceftriaxone and clindamycin, which was changed to \nvanco/cefepime/clindamycin with ID input. TTE and TEE were \nnegative for endocarditis. No evidence of embolic phenomenon \nwere noted. Final etiology was not clear at the time of transfer \nfrom the ICU, but ID felt patient likely had SBP which seeded \npatient hematogenously, which led to embolic phenomenon to the \nlower extremities. The ICU team felt that patient may have \nstarted with a soft tissue infection, which led to hemeatogenous \nspread, which may have then led to seeding of the peritoneal \nfluid. Strep pneumo has been described as a rare cause of \ncellulitis in case reports. Workup also included negative ANCA, \nrelatively normal complement, and negative CMV. When final \nspeciation from blood culture returned patient was transitioned \nto Ceftriaxone alone prior to transfer to the floor. Pt was \nafebrile while on ___ 10 with stable vital signs. Wound care \ncontinued to follow patient and daily dressing changes were \ninitated. While on ___ 10 patient complained of right lower \nback/upper buttock pain. Dermatology evaluated patient and felt \nthat the dermatomal distribution of the pain warranted VZV \nprohylaxis. Patient was swiftly transferred to ___ 5 to protect \ntransplant patients from VZV exposure. He was eventually found \nnot to have VZV and antivirals were stopped.  The patient's \ndistal lower extremity wounds were managed with antibiotics \nincluding the above Ceftriaxone and vancomycin which were \neventually discontinued and Daptomycin was started and stopped \nat time of discharge.\n.  \n#. Altered mental Status: Likely multifactorial related to \ninfection +/- hepatic encephalopathy and narcotics received in \nED with decreased ability to metabolize narcotics in setting of \nliver disease. Improved after extubation with lactulose and \nrifaximin.\n.  \n#. Hyponatremia: Concerning for hepatorenal vs hypovolemic \nhyponatremia. Diff also includes SIADH from pain. Improved with \nfluids while in the ICU. Because of his hypersosmolar urine on \nthe floor, he was presumed to have SIADH and he eventually was \nrestricted to 1500ml fluids per day on the floor and his \nhyponatremia reversed. He developed hyponatremia later in his \nhospital course which was again concerning for hepatorenal \nsyndrome. He was given IV concentrated albumin and his sodium \nremained stable and borderline low at time of discharge.\n.  \n# CKD: Cr 1.7 near baseline 1.6 on ___. Improved to baseline \nprior to transfer out of out the ICU and stabilized on the \nfloor.  \n.\n# Pancytopenia, coagulopathy: Platelets mildly below baseline, \nhct mildly below baseline, but WBC remained stable. Given \nelevated INR, there was some concern for DIC in the setting of \ninfection. CBC stabilized and INR improved with holding of \ncoumadin and treatment of infectious process. He developed \nneutropenia again later in his hospital course. Ceftriaxone and \nvancomycin were discontinued and his WBC count returned to a \nnormal range. \n.  \n#. Anemia/Bleeding from OGT: Hct 26 at most recent baseline 27 \nand stable. Had some blood mixed with bile from OGT and has \nknown varices but no further output. Received 2 U PRBC while in \nthe unit with stable Hct. Hct was stable on the floor. \n.  \n#. Cirrhosis ___ HCV c/b varices, ascites, h/o encephalopathy on \ntransplant list: Elevated INR and low albumin consistent with \ndecompensated cirrhosis. MELD 27 on admission but improved to 18 \nthereafter. Propanolol was held secondary to bradycardia in the \nICU. Continue on rifaximin, and lactulose was started for \naltered mental status that improved after extubation, now \nstopped. \n.\n# Volume status: Once he reached the floor, he had significant \nascites and ___ edema, diuresis was initiated first with lasix \nand eventually with both lasix and aldactone while monitoring \nhis electrolytes. He underwent a 3L paracentesis and was placed \non a 1500ml fluid restriction. His edema stabilized as did his \nserum sodium while on this regimen.    \n.  \n# Asthma: Currently without wheezing or resp symptoms.  \n.  \n#. Atrial fibrillation: Remained rate controlled. Coumadin \ninitially held for suprathereapeutic INR. Propanolol was held \nfor bradycardia and prolonged pr interval. While on ___ 10 \npatient was noted to be in sustained atrial flutter. Propranolol \nwas restarted at 5mg tid. Shortly after first dose patient was \nbradycardic to the high 40's. He appeared confused and \ncomplained of weakness. The decision was made to DC his \npropranolol again. His symptoms resolved shortly after that.  \nHis propanolol was not restarted on the floor. He also \nexperienced multiple 2 second pauses on telemtry during his time \non the floor. He was restarted on coumadin and discharged on a \ndose of 4mg with plans to follow his INR with Dr. ___ \nPCP.\n \nMedications on Admission:\nErgocalciferol ___ units daily  \nAlbuterol 2 puffs TID  \nSymbicort 160-4.5 2 puffs BID  \nClotrimazoel troche 10mg PO dissolved in mouth 5 times er day  \nFlutes 50meg spray suspension 2 spraysto each nostril daily  \nLasix 40mg 2 tabs PO daily  \nMethylphenidate 5mg PO TID  \nPantoprazole 40mg PO BID  \nProporanolol 10mg PO BID  \nRifaximin 400mg PO TID  \nSpironolactone 50mg PO daiky  \nCoumadin 5mg PO qhs  \ncalcium carbonate 600mg PO BID  \nDiphenydramine-Tylneol PO BID  \nFerrous sulfate 325mg PO TID  \nFolic acid ___ PO qam  \nGlucosamine Chondroitin Complex 1 tab PO BID  \nLoperamide 2mg PO BID  \nMagnesium oxide 1 tablet po qam  \n\n \nDischarge Medications:\n1.

It consists of a 2.5 cm long core \nbiopsy composed of focal skeletal muscle, periosteum, \nsubcortical bone and trabecular bone marrow with a cellularity \nof 40-50%. There is an interstitial infiltrate of immature \nmononuclear cells present in medium and large sized aggregates \nrepresenting 50-60% of the overall core biopsy cellularity. In \nthe remaining cellularity, erythroid precursors are relatively \nproportionately increased in number and have overall \nnormoblastic maturation. Maturing myeloid precursors are \nrelatively proportionately decreased in number and show some \nfull-spectrum maturation. Megakaryocytes are greatly increased \nin number with frequent tight clustering. Forms with widely \nspaced nuclei are seen. The clot sections are non-contributory. \nBy immunohistochemistry, the blast infiltrate is CD34 negative, \nCD117 positive and represents 50-60% of the overall core biopsy \ncellularity.

The patient was medically \nmanaged with intravenous antibiotics and bowel rest and \nsubsequently improved. Diet was slowly advanced without issues. \nThe patient remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable. \n\n# Perforated Acute Diverticulitis\n# Neutropenia\nPresented with worsening acute abdominal pain since being \ndischarged following the second cycle of MiDAC. CT abd/pelvis \nshowed a perforated acute diverticulitis. Evaluated by surgery \nand BMT in ED, and the decision was made to pursue conservative \nmanagement with IV antibiotics. She was initially started on \nvancomycin/zosyn overnight, switched to meropenem due to a \ncefepime allergy. Patient initially placed on bowel rest and \nthen advanced to regular diet without issues. Her pain resolved \nwith time, though 1 week later, while neutropenic, she developed \nan isolated temperature of 100.5 in the setting of 48 hours of \ncrampy \"gas like\" LLQ abdominal pain. Other vitals were stable. \nRepeat CT A/P with PO contrast demonstrated worsening of the \ndiverticulitis and perforation. Surgery consulted, recommended \nsurgery on this admission. However, given patient preference and \nhigh risk of surgery with neutropenia, we continued a \nconservative course, re-added vancomycin to her regimen for \nfebrile neutropenia and made her NPO; remained HD stable and \npain free. Decided not to use neupogen given again patient \npreference but also risk of bowel perf with neupogen. 7 days \nlater, once her neutrophils recovered and reached \u003e 3000, repeat \nCT A/P with oral contrast showed improvement in bowel edema and \nperforation. Discharged after 24 hours on oral cipro/flagyl and \nwith close follow up to oncology and instructions to call if any \nconcern for C.

Again seen is a waist-like narrowing in a RLQ loop of \nbowel, the likely transition site, from possible adhesion. \nInterval progression of previously administered oral contrast \nthrough the colon suggests only partial obstruction. \n\n___:  x-ray of the abdomen:\n\n  Two supine views of the mid and lower abdomen and a left \ndecubitus views show appreciable increase in the extent of \nseverely distended small bowel loops, most containing more air \nthan fluid, to maximum small bowel diameter of 64 mm, in the \nleft upper quadrant, compared to 59 mm on ___.  \nThese are findings of severe small bowel obstruction and were \nreported to Dr. ___ by Dr. ___, 9:35 p.m. on ___. \n\n___:  x-ray of the abdomen:\n\nIMPRESSION:  Two upright and three supine views of the abdomen \nshow a greater fluid in the severely distended small bowel, as \nwell as a slight increase in volume of gas passed to the large \nbowel, located in the transverse colon. Severe distension of the \nsmall bowel, maximum diameter from 5 to 6 cm, is comparable to \nthe appearance on ___, so it is unclear whether the increase \nin gas in the large colon is redistribution of residual gas or \nconstitutes minimal passage of small bowel contents through an \nincomplete obstruction.  \nThere is no free subdiaphragmatic gas.  Wall of the small bowel \nis minimally thicker today than it was yesterday but not \nseverely edematous and there is no intramural emphysema to \nsuggest necrosis. \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n \n  \n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\nThe patient was admitted to the hospital with nausea, \nvomitting,and abdominal distention. A ___ tube was \nplaced while the patient was in the emergency room with removal \nof 1.5 liters of feculent drainage.  THe patient underwent a cat \nscan of the abdomen which showed a small bowel obstruction with \nrelative transition point in the right lower quadrant.  Based on \nthese findings, the patient was placed on bowel rest and given \nintravenous fluids.  He underwent serial abdominal examinations. \nHis white blood cell count was closely monitored.  The patient \ntransitioned to clear liquids on HD #6 and gradually advanced to \na regular diet.  His abdominal assessment continued and there \nwas no recurrence of abdominal pain.  His foley catheter was \nremoved but required replacement after the patient failed to \nvoid.  He resumed his home medications, including his coumadin, \nwith close monitoring of his INR.  His white blood cell count \nnormalized.\n\nOn ___, Mr. ___ developed increasing abdominal pain.  He was \nkept NPO and given IV fluids during this time.  A nasogastric \ntube was inserted for gastric decompression.  A KUB showed \ndilated air-fluid loops of small bowel. \n\nOn ___, Mr. ___ had minimial NGT output and his NGT was \ndiscontinued.  His diet as advanced slowly to regular, which he \ninitially tolerated.  Unfortunately again, on ___, he began to \nhave abdominal pain with solid food and he was made NPO.  \nBecause of this recurrent pain with food, the patient was taken \nto the Operating Suite for an exploratory laparotomy and lysis \nof adhesions.  Prior the procedure, he required 4 units of FFP \ndue to an INR of 4.1.  He follow-up INR was 1.5.  The patient \ntolerated the procedure well.  He was recovered in PACU and \ntransferred back to the inpatient ward for further management.\n\nPost-operatively, Mr. ___ was NPO, given IV fluids and had a \nNGT for gastric decompression.  He was given narcotic and \nnon-narcotic analgesics for pain.  Due to his history of \nfrequent PEs/DVTs, he was started on a heparin drip with a goal \nPTT of 60-80.  Due to lack of adequate venous access, a PICC \nline was inserted.  \n\nDue to his poor nutritional status, Mr. ___ was started on \nTPN on ___ (HD 11).  Physical therapy worked with the patient \nto assess his mobility and encourage mobilization.  Because he \nwas not able to take oral medications, the patient required \nfrequent treatment of his hypertension (SBP 170-180s) using \nhydralazine 20mg IV.  \n\nOn ___, the patient's NGT was discontinued and his diet was \nadvanced to sips and then to clears as tolerated, which he \ninitially did well with.  His abdomen later became distended and \nhe complained of nausea and vomiting.  Again, a NGT was inserted \nand he was kept NPO.  As he began to improve, his NGT  was \ndiscontinued on ___.  He was started on a clear diet and he \nwas started on his oral medications, including coumadin.\n\nOn ___/, the patient was discharged to rehab on coumadin and \nlovenox for bridge therapy.

NG tube was placed but \ncame out overnight. Most likely etiology for her prior \npresentation was constipation, which may have been precipitated \nby methadone abuse in outpatient setting. Her symptoms at that \ntime wre managed medically with pantoprazole BID, standing \ntylenol and home methadone 7.5mg PO TID for pain, and an \naggressive bowel regimen (senna, colace, miralax, bisacodyl, \nenema). Her PCP had emailed on admission regarding concerns \nabout using methadone excessively at home, running out, then \nwithdrawing, and was in the process fo tapering methadone down \nas an outpatient. There have been concerns about opiate use in \nthe past as an outpatient. She was given zofran and compazine \nfor nausea with good relief.

No evidence of bowel obstruction with oral contrast passing \nto the level of the colon.\n \n2.  Stable mild dilatation of the CBD compared to the prior CT \nfrom ___, and again may be related to sphincter of \nOddi dysfunction.\n \n3.  Stable ___ opacities at the bases of the lungs \nbilaterally, likely secondary to small airways infection or \naspiration.\n\n \nBrief Hospital Course:\n___ with history of gastric bypass s/p reversal, esophagitis, \nchronic pain, PE presenting with odynophagia, nausea and \nabdominal pain.\n\n# Odynophagia: Differential included recurrent esophagitis vs \nesophageal or anastamotic ulcer vs infection. Without fevers and \nWBC stable from prior with known history of esophagitis and \nreport of lack of adherence to PPI at home, esophagitis was \nthought to be most likely etiology of ___ pain. Her \nesophagitis may also have been worsened by worsened reflux \nrelated to her constipation as below. Given stable hematocrit \nand no evidence of bleeding on exam, EGD was deferred on this \nadmission. Patient was treated with IV PPI BID then transitioned \nto omeprazole BID. Her pain was controlled with home methadone, \nsucralfate and maalox/diphenhydramine/lidocaine mouth wash with \ngood effect and patient was able to tolerate POs prior to \ndischarge. Patient should continue BID PPI until follow-up with \nGI as an outpatient next month. \n\n#Abdominal Pain/nausea/vomiting: Patient with significant pain \nto palpation particularly at LLQ with evidence of significant \nstool burden on CT abdomen on admission and no bowel movement \nfor 6 days prior to admission. No evidence of infection based on \nCT abdomen, WBC count and temperature (afebrile). Likely that \n___ constipation worsened by methadone and zofran which \ncan be constipating. Constipation treated with multiple mineral \noil and tap water enemas as well as miralax, colace and senna \nwith improvement in constipation and abdominal pain. Nausea \nimproved with relief of constipation and IV zofran. Patient was \ntransitioned back to higher dose of PO zofran prior to discharge \nwhich she tolerated well. Patient discharged on aggressive bowel \nregimen. Methadone (likely cause of constipation) to be tapered \nper PCP as below.\n\n# Chronic Pain: Per Dr. ___ PCP), patient is \ncurrently tapering methadone and was scheduled to taper to 5mg \ndaily on day of admission. In the setting of symptoms consistent \nwith esophagitis, further taper of methadone deferred and \npatient was continued on previous dosing of methadone 5mg BID \nwith plan for follow-up at ___ office on ___ for discussion \nregarding further methadone taper. \n\n# Pinpoint pupils and mild impaired responsiveness: Patient with \ndifficulty waking from sleep AM of ___ for ___ minutes. She was \nnoted to be difficult to wake fully with pinpoint pupils, \nanswering questions but unable to move more than a few inches in \nbed. Spontaneously improved with pupils dilated to baseline. \nUnclear etiology. No known seizure history, no post-ictal state. \nNeurology was curbsided and did not reel that description was \nconsistent with any classic seizure presentation. Patient with \nsimilar issue on last admission and is not sure if this happens \nsometimes at home as well. Other considerations for etiology \ninclude sleep disorder vs medication effect given multiple \ncentral acting medications. Patient scheduled for outpatient \nneurology follow-up. Would also consider outpatient sleep study \nif this persists. \n\n# Hx of DVT with PE in ___: PE and DVTs in setting of \nhospitalization and immobilization. Patient with subtherapeutic \n(normal) INR on admission with concern that patient has either \nnot been taking her coumadin or has been unable to absorb \nrelated to prior abdominal surgeries. Patient was continued on \nenoxaparin 70 BID and coumadin 7mg daily on this admission. INR \nof 1.0 on discharge. \n\n  \n# Depression/anxiety: Patient continued on home buproprion, \nclonazepam, doxepin, mirtazapine and seroquel once able to \ntolerate PO medications (HD2).\n \n--\nTransitional Issues:\n- Code: DNR/DNI (confirmed)\n- Emergency Contact: ___ (daughter and HCP): \n___\n- Please repeat MRCP in ___ or ___ for follow-up of possible \nsphincter of Oddi dysfunction\n- Consider social work for placement into day program. At this \ntime, ___ daughter comfortable with patient coming home \nbut concerned about her day time activities and hopeful for \nrespite during the day to help her mom improve\n-Patient with recurrent episode of lethargy on waking, pinpoint \npupils that spontaneously resolved. Per discussion with neuro, \nsymptoms not consistent with seizures but would consider further \nneuro work-up as outpatient and possible sleep study given \nepisodes occur when waking up\n-Continue taper of methadone to 5mg daily and off \n \nMedications on Admission:\nThe Preadmission Medication list is accurate and complete.\n1.

She was \ndischarged to ___ facility. \n[] PO intake was very poor while patient while hospitalized, \nthought to be related to her disease progression. Patient also \nhad clear dysphagia, and was recommended to have food \nlimitations due to concern for aspiration, but her family \npreferred to accept aspiration risks and allow patient to eat \nfor comfort. \n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n====================\n___ F with frontotemporal dementia c/b progressive aphasia, \nHIV, MDD with psychotic features, anxiety and recent admission \nfor rhabdomyolysis, constipation and urinary retention who \npresents with diarrhea with neg c diff, failure to thrive, found \nto have labs with elevated CKs c/f rhabdo, which normalized \nafter IVF resuscitation. Hospitalization complicated by UTIs. \nGiven her severe frontotemporal dementia and disease \nprogression, goals of care were extensively discussed. After \ndiscussions with family, patient was transitioned to \ncomfort-focused care, and was discharged to ___ with hospice.\n\nACUTE/ACTIVE ISSUES:\n====================\n# GOC\n# Failure to thrive: Patient with multiple recent admissions. \nShe has been spitting out her PO medications at home and in this \nhospitalization as well. Currently lives at home with daughter \nwho provides most of her care, but has been struggling to do so. \nMOLST completed, and patient was made DNR/DNI/no escalation of \ncare. Given her severe frontotemporal dementia and disease \nprogression, goals of care were extensively discussed. After \ndiscussions with family, patient was transitioned to \ncomfort-focused care, and was discharged to ___ with hospice.\n\n# FTD c/b primary progressive aphasia\n# Cognitive impairment\n# MDD with psychotic features\nPt with known FTD. Discussed case with ___ cognitive \nneurologist Dr. ___ recommended tapering home valproic \nacid, which was DC'd on ___. Continued home mirtazapine, \nmemantine, risperidone and perphenazine and clonazepam PRN \n(although of note, patient had difficulty tolerating pills on \nmany days, as she had trouble swallowing and would pocket pills \nwithout swallowing them). Pt placed on delirium precautions. \n\n# Dysphagia\nLikely related to underlying FTD. Concern that patient is not \nable to fully swallow food and medications, although did not \nhave witnessed aspiration events while hospitalized. SLP \nevaluated patient on ___ and recommended puree/thin diet, as \npatient was high aspiration risk and had severely impaired \nswallowing. Discussed with family, who preferred to accept \naspiration risks and allow for comfort feeds, especially given \ntransition in goals of care as outlined above.\n\n# Urinary Tract Infections\n# Urinary retention\nSeen in ED on ___, diagnosed with UTI. Started on macrobid on \n___ given Foley in place ___ failed voiding trial, so \ncatheter was kept in place on discharge for plan with urology \nfollow up. Foley since removed, and Purewick used throughout \nhospitalization given ongoing incontinence. RN noted \nfoul-smelling urine on ___. Urine culture from ___ grew \u003e100,000 \nE.coli, so patient was started on antibiotics, and completed a \n7-day course of ceftriaxone (___). At time of discharge, \nurine output was declining, suspected to be due to poor PO \nintake, but given transition in goals of care as above, this was \nnot further explored. \n\nRESOLVED:\n========\n#Elevated CK: Likely in the setting of recent immobility and \ninfection given URI symptoms. Less likely from psych meds given \nno good studies to suggest causality, so medications were \ncontinued. CK improved to 71 at time of discharge. TSH, free T4 \nnormal. \n\n#Diarrhea: Patient with diarrhea on admission, abdomen non \ntender and without peritoneal signs. C diff negative x2.

Pt \nwith history of CAD s/p RCA stent ___. Pt had not been having \nchest pain at home until the night prior to admission and has \nnot had to use nitroglycerin at home in many years. Pain began \nat rest which pointed away from a cardiac etiology. It was \nrelieved with nitro in the ED, but EKG showed changes c/w \ninferior wall ischemia. Cath revealed clean coronaries, \nfollow-up EKG showing the majority of EKG changes had resolved. \nPericarditis was considered in the differential, or possibly a \nsmall clot that had auto-lysed or travelled more distally. It \nwas felt that the most convincing explanation was a vasospastic \nprocess as he did exhibit self-reversing ST elevations (duly \nnoted that vasospasm classically occurs in young women. Still, \npt's amlodipine was uptitrated and home atenolol discontinued in \nfavor of imdur for blood pressure control. Home aspirin was \ncontinued as well. In the future should pt have continued chest \npain or ST changes would give consideration to vasospastic \nangina.\n.\n#CAD - h/o CAD s/p stent to the proximal RCA in ___. Clean \ncoronaries per cath ___. Pt was maintained on aspirin, and \nsimvastatin. Home atenolol was discontinued out of concern for \nexacerbating vasospasm. \n.  \n#  Hyponatremia - initially with Na of 130. Sodium remained \nstable at this level, pt asx, and it was felt attributable to \nhis hydrochlorothiazide with possibly some component of \ndecreased PO intake in the setting of chest pain. \n.  \n# leukocytosis - pt presented with WBC of 13.9, attributable to \nmyocardial ischemia or stress response. Pt did not have any \nlocalizing signs of infection, WBC trended down immediately and \nhe was never febrile. \n.\n# HTN - Pt remained normotensive - home amlodipine was \nuptitrated, atenolol DCd in favor of imdur. ___ was discharged \nalso on lisinopril (previous home med). \n.  \n#GERD - continued home omeprazole.\n.\nPt was maintained as FULL CODE throughout the course of this \nhospitalization.\n\n \nMedications on Admission:\n1.

You came in with chest pain. Some changes on \nyour EKG suggested it might be related to a problem with your \nheart so a cardiac catheterization was performed. This showed \nthat you did not have any blockages in the arteries that supply \nyour heart. We think that you might have a little bit of \nirritation of the lining around the heart which could cause this \npain, or also likely is that one of the arteries had a brief \nspasm which constricted blood flow to the heart. \n.\nWe made the following CHANGES to your medications:\nINCREASED amlodipine from 5mg to 10mg. Now take 10mg daily.\nSTOPPED atenolol\nSTARTED imdur 30mg daily\n.\nPlease take all other home medications as previously directed.\n \nFollowup Instructions:\n___\n"}

Previous etiology concerning \nfor\nmedication-induced prolonged QTC (currently 523). Had been \ncontrolled on Metoprolol, Verapamil during prior EP study \nwithout focus amenable to ablation. ICD interrogation consistent \nwith acute sustained PMVT appropriately self-terminated after \nATP and no shock delivered. Patient with known ischemic \ncardiomyopathy (EF previously recovered, now reduced), though no \nevidence of acute ischemic event. Possible contribution of scar \nfrom prior XRT to the chest. Patient on verapamil, amid, \nmetoprolol and mexiletine with little room for maximizing doses. \nHe complicated an amiodarone load and transitioned to 400mg QD \nprior to discharge. As he was not a great candidate for surgery \ngiven comorbidities, and PVCs appeared predominantly unifocal, \ndecision to VT ablate was made and performed on ___. His \nmexiletine was also discontinued prior to discharge. He was sent \nhome on amiodarone and verapamil. \n\n# HFrEF\nHad previous reduced EF with recovery, most recent TTE showing \nEF reduced again to 35%. Differential included myocardial \nstunning from recent ICD shocks vs. ischemic vs. non-ischemic \netiologies. Patient does have history of CAD, however, due to \nlife expectancy with comorbid stage IV NSCLC, coronary \nangiography was not pursued. There was no role for ischemic \nwork-up for now and can repeat TTE as an outpatient and pursue \nfurther workup if EF continues to be depressed, as current \ndecline in systolic function likely ___ episodes of VT and ICD \ndischarges. Patient was continued on metoprolol and \nspironolactone throughout.\n\n#Elevated Transaminases\nPossibly ___ recent Amiodarone. No RUQ pain. Mildly elevated \nINR. AST downtrended to WNL. ALT remained mildly elevated at 98 \non discharge.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n#___\n#Pleural Effusions\nPer outpatient oncologist, currently on third line therapy with \nplan to repeat chest CT as an outpatient to assess disease \nburden. Will also be considered for clinical trials based on \nadequate performance status. Cytology with metastatic \nadenocarcinoma. Patient is on Gemzar 1000 ___ week 4 off.\n\n#Hypertension\nPatient with history of hypertension. Continued on \nspironolactone, metoprolol and lisinopril during course.\n\n#CAD\nUnikely that patient would have undergone coronary angiogram \ngiven comorbidities so was not worked up as possible contributor \nto dysrrhythmia. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\nDISCHARGE WEIGHT: 72.6kg (160.05 lbs) \nDISCHARGE Cr/BUN: 0.9 \nMEDICATION CHANGES: \n- NEW: \nNone\n\n- STOPPED: \nMexiletine \n\n- CHANGED:\nAmiodarone 400mg TID to ___ QD \nMetoprolol succinate 50mg QD to 50mg BID\n\n[] QTc was prolonged to 524 prior to discharge.

The etiology for angioedema is not entirely \nclear. This is first event and she was not taking an ACEI. \nNSAIDs are the medication she is on that could be associated \nwith angioedema, and she did take Motrin the night prior to \ndeveloping facial and tongue swelling. Estrogens can also be \nassociated so her OCP could be a rare culprit, so her OCPs were \ndiscontinued during this hospitalization. \n\nHer symptoms are mostly isolated angioedema and she does not \nhave report of concurrent symptoms to suggest an allergic \nprocess associated with mast cell activation such \npruritis/flushing or uricaria. This suggests more likely a \nbradykinin-mediated process. Given her young age and isolated \nangioedema, can also consider possibility of C1 inhibitor \ndeficiency so C1 inhibitor level sent off. \n\nTherapeutically, she was given methylprednisone, IV benadryl and \nIV pepcid. Her swelling improved and she was extubated on \nhospital day 1. She was monitored for an additional 24 hours, \nand discharged with normal appearing oropharynx and tongue. \nNSAIDs were added to her allergy list and OCPs discontinued.
