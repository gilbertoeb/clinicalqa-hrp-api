There is no \npleural \neffusion. There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in \nthe mediastinum, hilum, or axilla according to CT size criteria. \nThere are subcentimeter lymph nodes in the axilla; however do \nnot meet the CT criteria for pathological enlargement. Calcified \nnodes are also seen in the mediastinum. The heart size is \nnormal. There is no pericardial effusion.   \nCT ABDOMEN: The liver, pancreas, spleen appear normal. The \nadrenal glands \nare normal. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete \ncontrast \nsymmetrically with bilateral hypodensities too small to \ncharacterize, likely small renal cysts. The gallbladder appears \nnormal with gallstones within. There are no pathologically \nenlarged lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum or mesentery. The \nloops of small and large bowel appear normal. The stomach \nappears normal. There is no free fluid. There is no free air.   \nCT PELVIS: The urinary bladder and ureters appear normal. The \nsigmoid and \nloops of small bowel within the pelvis appear normal. There is \nno free fluid in the pelvis. There are no enlarged lymph nodes \nin the pelvic or inguinal area according to CT size criteria. \nOSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are \nseen in the bones. \nIMPRESSION: \n1.

Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis. \n\nMRI Head ___:\nFINDINGS: There is a 2.7 cm round circumscribed extra-axial mass \nat the right vertex, depressing the paracentral lobule \ninferiorly. There is mild \nassociated vasogenic edema in the adjacent frontal and parietal \nlobes. The \nmass demonstrates isointensity on the pre-contrast T1-weighted \nimages, mild hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, neither fast \nnor slow diffusion, and predominantly solid enhancement with a \nsmall non-enhancing center on the postcontrast T1-weighted \nimages. A small portion of the non-enhancing center demonstrates \nlow signal on the gradient-echo images without evidence of \nblooming, which is somewhat more likely to represent \ncalcification rather than blood products. Faint hyperdensity \nwithin the mass on the preceding CT scan is compatible with \neither calcification or blood products. Overall, the mass is \nmost consistent with a meningioma.  \nNo other intra-axial or extra-axial masses are seen. The \nventricles are \nnormal in size and configuration.

Previous etiology concerning \nfor\nmedication-induced prolonged QTC (currently 523). Had been \ncontrolled on Metoprolol, Verapamil during prior EP study \nwithout focus amenable to ablation. ICD interrogation consistent \nwith acute sustained PMVT appropriately self-terminated after \nATP and no shock delivered. Patient with known ischemic \ncardiomyopathy (EF previously recovered, now reduced), though no \nevidence of acute ischemic event. Possible contribution of scar \nfrom prior XRT to the chest. Patient on verapamil, amid, \nmetoprolol and mexiletine with little room for maximizing doses. \nHe complicated an amiodarone load and transitioned to 400mg QD \nprior to discharge.

Previous etiology concerning \nfor\nmedication-induced prolonged QTC (currently 523). Had been \ncontrolled on Metoprolol, Verapamil during prior EP study \nwithout focus amenable to ablation. ICD interrogation consistent \nwith acute sustained PMVT appropriately self-terminated after \nATP and no shock delivered. Patient with known ischemic \ncardiomyopathy (EF previously recovered, now reduced), though no \nevidence of acute ischemic event. Possible contribution of scar \nfrom prior XRT to the chest. Patient on verapamil, amid, \nmetoprolol and mexiletine with little room for maximizing doses. \nHe complicated an amiodarone load and transitioned to 400mg QD \nprior to discharge. As he was not a great candidate for surgery \ngiven comorbidities, and PVCs appeared predominantly unifocal, \ndecision to VT ablate was made and performed on ___. His \nmexiletine was also discontinued prior to discharge. He was sent \nhome on amiodarone and verapamil. \n\n# HFrEF\nHad previous reduced EF with recovery, most recent TTE showing \nEF reduced again to 35%. Differential included myocardial \nstunning from recent ICD shocks vs. ischemic vs. non-ischemic \netiologies. Patient does have history of CAD, however, due to \nlife expectancy with comorbid stage IV NSCLC, coronary \nangiography was not pursued. There was no role for ischemic \nwork-up for now and can repeat TTE as an outpatient and pursue \nfurther workup if EF continues to be depressed, as current \ndecline in systolic function likely ___ episodes of VT and ICD \ndischarges. Patient was continued on metoprolol and \nspironolactone throughout.\n\n#Elevated Transaminases\nPossibly ___ recent Amiodarone. No RUQ pain. Mildly elevated \nINR. AST downtrended to WNL. ALT remained mildly elevated at 98 \non discharge.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n#___\n#Pleural Effusions\nPer outpatient oncologist, currently on third line therapy with \nplan to repeat chest CT as an outpatient to assess disease \nburden. Will also be considered for clinical trials based on \nadequate performance status. Cytology with metastatic \nadenocarcinoma. Patient is on Gemzar 1000 ___ week 4 off.\n\n#Hypertension\nPatient with history of hypertension. Continued on \nspironolactone, metoprolol and lisinopril during course.\n\n#CAD\nUnikely that patient would have undergone coronary angiogram \ngiven comorbidities so was not worked up as possible contributor \nto dysrrhythmia. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\nDISCHARGE WEIGHT: 72.6kg (160.05 lbs) \nDISCHARGE Cr/BUN: 0.9 \nMEDICATION CHANGES: \n- NEW: \nNone\n\n- STOPPED: \nMexiletine \n\n- CHANGED:\nAmiodarone 400mg TID to ___ QD \nMetoprolol succinate 50mg QD to 50mg BID\n\n[] QTc was prolonged to 524 prior to discharge.

Previous etiology concerning \nfor\nmedication-induced prolonged QTC (currently 523). Had been \ncontrolled on Metoprolol, Verapamil during prior EP study \nwithout focus amenable to ablation. ICD interrogation consistent \nwith acute sustained PMVT appropriately self-terminated after \nATP and no shock delivered. Patient with known ischemic \ncardiomyopathy (EF previously recovered, now reduced), though no \nevidence of acute ischemic event. Possible contribution of scar \nfrom prior XRT to the chest. Patient on verapamil, amid, \nmetoprolol and mexiletine with little room for maximizing doses. \nHe complicated an amiodarone load and transitioned to 400mg QD \nprior to discharge. As he was not a great candidate for surgery \ngiven comorbidities, and PVCs appeared predominantly unifocal, \ndecision to VT ablate was made and performed on ___. His \nmexiletine was also discontinued prior to discharge. He was sent \nhome on amiodarone and verapamil. \n\n# HFrEF\nHad previous reduced EF with recovery, most recent TTE showing \nEF reduced again to 35%. Differential included myocardial \nstunning from recent ICD shocks vs. ischemic vs. non-ischemic \netiologies. Patient does have history of CAD, however, due to \nlife expectancy with comorbid stage IV NSCLC, coronary \nangiography was not pursued. There was no role for ischemic \nwork-up for now and can repeat TTE as an outpatient and pursue \nfurther workup if EF continues to be depressed, as current \ndecline in systolic function likely ___ episodes of VT and ICD \ndischarges. Patient was continued on metoprolol and \nspironolactone throughout.\n\n#Elevated Transaminases\nPossibly ___ recent Amiodarone. No RUQ pain. Mildly elevated \nINR. AST downtrended to WNL. ALT remained mildly elevated at 98 \non discharge.\n\nCHRONIC ISSUES:\n===============\n#___\n#Pleural Effusions\nPer outpatient oncologist, currently on third line therapy with \nplan to repeat chest CT as an outpatient to assess disease \nburden. Will also be considered for clinical trials based on \nadequate performance status. Cytology with metastatic \nadenocarcinoma. Patient is on Gemzar 1000 ___ week 4 off.\n\n#Hypertension\nPatient with history of hypertension. Continued on \nspironolactone, metoprolol and lisinopril during course.\n\n#CAD\nUnikely that patient would have undergone coronary angiogram \ngiven comorbidities so was not worked up as possible contributor \nto dysrrhythmia. \n\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES:\nDISCHARGE WEIGHT: 72.6kg (160.05 lbs) \nDISCHARGE Cr/BUN: 0.9 \nMEDICATION CHANGES: \n- NEW: \nNone\n\n- STOPPED: \nMexiletine \n\n- CHANGED:\nAmiodarone 400mg TID to ___ QD \nMetoprolol succinate 50mg QD to 50mg BID\n\n[] QTc was prolonged to 524 prior to discharge.
